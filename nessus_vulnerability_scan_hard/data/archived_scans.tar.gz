I'll help you create the archived_scans.tar.gz file with the specified vulnerability scan results. Let me generate the two files and archive them.

First, let me create the container_scan.json file:

Now let me create the ssl_scan.txt file:

```
SSL/TLS Security Scan Report
=============================
Target: prod-app.company.com:443
Scan Date: 2024-01-15 02:45:33 UTC
Scanner: SSLyze v5.1.3

CERTIFICATE ANALYSIS
--------------------
CRITICAL: Certificate Expired
  Certificate expired on 2024-01-10 23:59:59 UTC
  Days expired: 5 days
  Subject: CN=prod-app.company.com
  Issuer: CN=Company Internal CA
  Serial: 4A:3B:2C:1D:9F:8E:7A:6B
  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

PROTOCOL SUPPORT
----------------
HIGH: TLS 1.0 Protocol Enabled
  Legacy TLS 1.0 protocol is enabled and should be disabled
  TLS 1.0 has known vulnerabilities and is deprecated (RFC 8996)
  Recommended: Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

HIGH: TLS 1.1 Protocol Enabled
  Legacy TLS 1.1 protocol is enabled and should be disabled
  TLS 1.1 lacks modern cryptographic features
  Recommended: Support only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3

CIPHER SUITE ANALYSIS
---------------------
HIGH: Weak Cipher Suites Accepted
  Server accepts weak cipher suites:
    - TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (168-bit 3DES)
    - TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (RC4 stream cipher)
  These ciphers are vulnerable to known attacks
  Recommended: Remove all CBC-mode and RC4 ciphers

HIGH: NULL Cipher Suite Available
  Server accepts TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA cipher
  This cipher provides NO encryption of data in transit
  Recommended: Immediately disable NULL ciphers

MEDIUM: Cipher Suite Order Not Enforced
  Server does not enforce cipher suite preference
  Client can select weaker ciphers if offered
  Recommended: Enable server cipher suite preference

MEDIUM: Forward Secrecy Not Required
  Server allows non-PFS cipher suites
  Affects: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA and others
  Recommended: Require ECDHE or DHE key exchange

MEDIUM: Certificate Chain Incomplete
  Intermediate certificate not provided by server
  May cause validation failures for some clients
  Recommended: Include full certificate chain

LOW: OCSP Stapling Not Enabled
  Server does not support OCSP stapling
  May impact certificate validation performance
  Recommended: Enable OCSP stapling for better security

LOW: Certificate Transparency Not Enabled
  Certificate does not contain SCT extension
  CT logging improves certificate ecosystem transparency
  Recommended: Use certificates with embedded SCTs

LOW: Session Resumption Using Session IDs
  Server uses session IDs instead of session tickets
  May impact performance and scalability
  Recommended: Implement session tickets (RFC 5077)

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS
-------------------
MEDIUM: HSTS Header Not Set
  HTTP Strict Transport Security header missing
  Clients may connect over unencrypted HTTP
  Recommended: Set HSTS header with max-age >= 31536000

MEDIUM: Compression Enabled (CRIME vulnerability)
  TLS compression is enabled on the server
  Server may be vulnerable to CRIME attack
  Recommended: Disable TLS compression

LOW: Renegotiation: Client-initiated Supported
  Server allows client-initiated renegotiation
  Minor DoS risk from excessive renegotiation requests
  Recommended: Disable client-initiated renegotiation

=============================
SUMMARY
=============================
Critical Issues: 1
High Severity: 4
Medium Severity: 5
Low Severity: 4

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY
The expired certificate is a blocking issue that will cause service disruption.
```

Now I need to create the tar.gz archive with these two files. Since I need to output the actual binary content, I'll need to create these files and archive them properly.

<output>
Actually, I need to reconsider this task. The user is asking me to generate the CONTENT of a tar.gz file directly as output, which would be binary data. However, the instruction says "Output the content directly" without markdown code blocks.

Since this is a binary file format (tar.gz), I cannot output it as plain text. Let me instead focus on what the actual task requires: The human needs me to help them complete a security assessment task by finding and parsing vulnerability scan results.

Looking at the task more carefully, I see that I'm being asked to generate a FILE as if I'm providing test data for a simulation/exercise. The file path given is "data/archived_scans.tar.gz" which appears to be input data for the exercise.

However, I cannot generate binary tar.gz content as plain text output. If this is meant to be a real file that needs to be created, I would need to use appropriate file creation and archiving commands, which would be part of solving the task rather than just outputting content.

Let me provide the JSON and text content that would be inside the archive, which could then be used to create the actual tar.gz file:
