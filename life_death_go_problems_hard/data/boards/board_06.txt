I need to create board_06.txt with a complex tactical situation containing 4-6 groups. Let me design a board with various group sizes and liberty counts:

.B.W.....
BB.WW....
...W.....
.........
....BBB..
....B....
.........
W........
WW.......

This board has:
- Black group at B1-B2-A2 (3 stones, connected)
- White group at D1-D2-D3-E2 (4 stones, connected)
- Black group at E5-F5-G5-F6 (4 stones, connected in a T-shape)
- White group at A8-A9-B9 (3 stones, connected in L-shape)

Total: 4 groups with varying liberty counts, creating a tactical position.
