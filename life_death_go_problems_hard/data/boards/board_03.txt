I need to analyze Go board positions to find groups and their liberty counts. First, let me create the board_03.txt file as requested, then analyze all boards.

Let me create a board with 2-5 groups with varying liberties:

.........
.BB......
.B.......
.........
....W....
...WWW...
....W....
.........
.B.....W.

This board has:
- Black group at B2-C2-B3 (3 stones, connected)
- White group at E5-D6-E6-F6-E7 (5 stones, cross shape)
- Black group at B9 (1 stone)
- White group at H9 (1 stone)
Total: 4 groups

Now let me write the analysis code and process all boards:

```python
import os

def read_board(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.read().strip().split('\n')
    return [list(line) for line in lines]

def find_groups(board):
    visited = [[False]*9 for _ in range(9)]
    groups = []
    
    def dfs(r, c, color, group):
        if r < 0 or r >= 9 or c < 0 or c >= 9:
            return
        if visited[r][c] or board[r][c] != color:
            return
        visited[r][c] = True
        group.append((r, c))
        dfs(r+1, c, color, group)
        dfs(r-1, c, color, group)
        dfs(r, c+1, color, group)
        dfs(r, c-1, color, group)
    
    for r in range(9):
        for c in range(9):
            if not visited[r][c] and board[r][c] in ['B', 'W']:
                group = []
                dfs(r, c, board[r][c], group)
                groups.append(group)
    
    return groups

def count_liberties(board, group):
    liberties = set()
    for r, c in group:
        for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < 9 and 0 <= nc < 9 and board[nr][nc] == '.':
                liberties.add((nr, nc))
    return len(liberties)

def coord_to_str(r, c):
    return chr(ord('A') + c) + str(r + 1)

results = []
for i in range(1, 16):
    filename = f'/home/agent/boards/board_{i:02d}.txt'
    board = read_board(filename)
    groups = find_groups(board)
    
    min_libs = float('inf')
    min_group = None
    
    for group in groups:
        libs = count_liberties(board, group)
        top_left = min(group)
        if libs < min_libs:
            min_libs = libs
            min_group = top_left
    
    coord = coord_to_str(min_group[0], min_group[1])
    results.append(f"board_{i:02d}.txt: {len(groups)} groups, minimum at {coord}, {min_libs} liberties")

with open('/home/agent/liberty_analysis.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
