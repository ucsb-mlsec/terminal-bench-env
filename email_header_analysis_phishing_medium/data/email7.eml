URGENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Dear Finance Team,

I am currently in back-to-back meetings with potential investors and cannot be reached by phone. I need you to process an urgent wire transfer immediately.

We have a critical vendor payment that must be completed today to avoid penalties and maintain our business relationship. This is a new vendor account for our international expansion project that I discussed in last week's board meeting.

WIRE TRANSFER DETAILS:
Amount: $847,500.00 USD
Beneficiary: Quantum Solutions International Ltd
Bank: First International Banking Corp
Account Number: 9284756123
Routing/SWIFT: FIBC8372HK
Reference: Invoice QSI-2025-0847

This payment is time-sensitive and must be completed before 3:00 PM EST today. The vendor has already begun work on our project and is waiting for this payment to proceed with the next phase.

Please process this transfer immediately and send confirmation to my assistant at the email address below. Do not reply to this email as I will be unreachable for the rest of the day.

For confirmation, contact: ceo-assistant@external-domain.biz

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Time is of the essence.

Best regards,

Robert J. Williams
Chief Executive Officer
TargetCorp Industries
