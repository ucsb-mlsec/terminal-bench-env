Dear Team,

We are pleased to announce updates to our Paid Time Off (PTO) policy that will take effect on February 1, 2025. These changes are designed to provide greater flexibility and work-life balance for all employees.

Key Changes:

1. PTO Accrual: All full-time employees will now accrue PTO at an enhanced rate:
   - 0-2 years of service: 15 days per year
   - 3-5 years of service: 20 days per year
   - 6+ years of service: 25 days per year

2. Carryover Policy: Employees may now carry over up to 10 unused PTO days into the next calendar year, up from the previous limit of 5 days.

3. PTO Request Process: We are implementing a new self-service portal accessible through the employee intranet. Requests will be processed within 48 hours.

4. Sick Leave: Sick leave will now be tracked separately from PTO, with all employees receiving 7 days of sick leave annually that does not affect PTO balances.

Important Dates:
- January 28, 2025: Training sessions on the new PTO portal (calendar invites to follow)
- February 1, 2025: New policy effective date
- February 1, 2025: All existing PTO balances will be migrated to the new system

Please review the complete policy document available on the HR SharePoint site under "Policies & Procedures." If you have questions, please contact the HR team at hr@targetcorp.com or call extension 5100.

We encourage you to schedule a brief one-on-one with your manager to discuss any PTO plans for the upcoming year.

Thank you for your continued dedication to TargetCorp.

Best regards,

Human Resources Department
