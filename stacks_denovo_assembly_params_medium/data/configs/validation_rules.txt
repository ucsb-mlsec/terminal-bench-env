Constraint: distance_relationship
Description: The catalog distance parameter (n) must be equal to or greater than the stack distance parameter (M) to ensure proper locus matching
Condition: n >= M

Constraint: min_coverage_threshold
Description: Minimum stack depth must be at least 3 to ensure reliability and reduce false positives from sequencing errors
Condition: m >= 3

Constraint: max_distance_limit
Description: Stack distance (M) should not exceed 5 for typical RAD-seq datasets to prevent merging of paralogous loci
Condition: M <= 5

Constraint: catalog_distance_limit
Description: Catalog distance (n) should not exceed 7 to maintain biological relevance and prevent spurious matches
Condition: n <= 7

Constraint: high_coverage_constraint
Description: When minimum coverage (m) is high (>= 10), minimum samples per population should be reduced to avoid losing too many loci
Condition: if m >= 10, then min_samples_per_pop <= 5

Constraint: low_coverage_warning
Description: When minimum coverage (m) is very low (< 5), stack distance (M) should be conservative (M <= 3) to avoid artifacts
Condition: if m < 5, then M <= 3

Constraint: population_sampling_limit
Description: Minimum samples per population must not exceed 20 for practical dataset sizes
Condition: min_samples_per_pop <= 20

Constraint: divergent_population_constraint
Description: For highly divergent populations (n >= 5), minimum samples per population should be at least 2 to ensure locus reliability
Condition: if n >= 5, then min_samples_per_pop >= 2
