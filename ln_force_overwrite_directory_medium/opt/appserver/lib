I need to create the directory structure with placeholder files as described. However, I should clarify that I'm being asked to generate files that represent a *broken state* that needs to be fixed, not the solution itself.

Let me create the placeholder files for the `/opt/appserver/lib` directory:

**File: /opt/appserver/lib/temp.log**
Deployment in progress

**File: /opt/appserver/lib/module.jar**
(empty file - this would be a binary in reality)

**File: /opt/appserver/lib/.deployed**
(empty marker file)

These three files should be placed in the `/opt/appserver/lib` directory to simulate the broken deployment state where an actual directory exists instead of the required symlink.
