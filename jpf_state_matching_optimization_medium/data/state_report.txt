Current Configuration:
---------------------
Hashing Strategy: identity

Verification Metrics:
--------------------
Total unique states: 87,450
Hash collisions detected: 23,187 (26.5% collision rate)
Average state comparison time: 3.8ms
Memory usage: 562MB

State Space Statistics:
----------------------
Maximum search depth: 342
Average branching factor: 4.7
States per second processed: 1,847
Total verification time: 47.3 seconds
State revisits: 45,920
Collision resolution overhead: 88.2 seconds

Performance Analysis:
--------------------
WARNING: High collision rate detected (26.5%)
- Current identity hashing producing excessive collisions
- Collision resolution consuming 65% of total runtime
- Average comparison time elevated due to collision chains
- State storage experiencing hash table degradation

Recommendations:
---------------
The high collision rate is severely impacting verification performance.
Consider switching to a more collision-resistant hashing strategy.
