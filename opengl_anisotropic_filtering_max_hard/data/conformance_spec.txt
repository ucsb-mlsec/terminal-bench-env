OpenGL Conformance Specification v3.2
Minimum Hardware Requirements for Certified Implementations
============================================================

INTRODUCTION

This document defines the minimum conformance requirements for OpenGL 3.2 
implementations seeking certification. All implementations must meet or exceed 
the capabilities specified herein to be considered conformant. These requirements 
ensure baseline functionality across different hardware vendors and generations.

Conformance testing validates that an implementation correctly exposes the 
required capabilities and operates within acceptable tolerance ranges. This 
specification is maintained by the conformance working group and updated 
periodically to reflect evolving hardware capabilities and industry standards.

Hardware vendors must submit capability dumps from their implementations along 
with conformance test results for certification review.

============================================================
MINIMUM REQUIRED CAPABILITIES
============================================================

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
Minimum Value: 8192
Description: Maximum texture dimension (width or height) for 2D textures.
This ensures adequate texture resolution for modern rendering applications.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS
Minimum Value: 8192, 8192
Description: Maximum viewport dimensions (width and height). Must support
rendering to viewports of at least this size in both dimensions.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS
Minimum Value: 8
Description: Number of simultaneous output buffers for fragment shader
outputs. Required for advanced rendering techniques like deferred shading.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_TEXTURE_MAX_ANISOTROPY_EXT
Minimum Value: 8.0
Description: Maximum degree of anisotropic filtering. This capability must 
be at least 8.0 for conformance certification. Anisotropic filtering is 
essential for high-quality texture sampling at oblique angles.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_SAMPLES
Minimum Value: 4
Description: Maximum MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing) sample count. Must
support at least 4x MSAA for framebuffer attachments.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS
Minimum Value: 16
Description: Maximum number of vertex attributes that can be accessed by
vertex shaders. Required for complex vertex processing pipelines.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS
Minimum Value: 1024
Description: Maximum number of uniform components available to vertex shaders.
Ensures sufficient uniform storage for transformation matrices and parameters.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS
Minimum Value: 1024
Description: Maximum number of uniform components available to fragment shaders.
Required for material properties and lighting calculations.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_VARYING_COMPONENTS
Minimum Value: 60
Description: Maximum number of interpolated components passed between vertex
and fragment shaders. Supports complex per-fragment data requirements.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS
Minimum Value: 32
Description: Total number of texture image units accessible across all shader
stages. Essential for multi-texture rendering techniques.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE
Minimum Value: 4096
Description: Maximum dimension for cube map texture faces. Required for
environment mapping and reflection effects.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE
Minimum Value: 8192
Description: Maximum dimension for renderbuffer objects. Must match or exceed
maximum texture size for framebuffer operations.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS
Minimum Value: 8
Description: Maximum number of color attachments in framebuffer objects.
Must align with GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS for MRT rendering.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS
Minimum Value: 16
Description: Number of texture units accessible from vertex shaders. Required
for displacement mapping and vertex texture fetch operations.

REQUIRED CAPABILITY: GL_MAX_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS
Minimum Value: 4.0
Description: Maximum absolute texture level-of-detail bias value. Controls
mipmap selection sharpness and detail levels.

============================================================
CONFORMANCE TESTING PROCEDURES
============================================================

Implementation vendors must execute the official conformance test suite and
submit complete capability dumps from representative hardware configurations.

Capability dumps must be generated from properly initialized OpenGL contexts
with all required extensions available. The testing environment should
represent typical deployment scenarios for the target hardware.

All capability values will be validated against these minimum requirements.
Failure to meet any single requirement results in non-conformance status.
Additional functional tests verify correct behavior of exposed capabilities.
