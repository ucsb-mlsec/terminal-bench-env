I'll analyze the CUDA patterns to determine their compatibility with CUDA graph capture. Let me start by reading the pattern files.

<analysis>
Let me read each pattern file to understand the CUDA usage scenarios:

Pattern 01: Reading the file to understand the usage pattern
Pattern 02: Already described - involves cudaDeviceSynchronize() between kernel launches
Pattern 03-08: Need to read these files

Based on CUDA graph capture restrictions:
- CPU-GPU synchronization (cudaDeviceSynchronize, cudaStreamSynchronize) cannot be captured
- Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation cannot be captured
- Operations that depend on GPU results for control flow cannot be captured
- Certain runtime API calls cannot be captured
- Stream queries and device state queries have limitations

Let me read all pattern files and create the analysis.
