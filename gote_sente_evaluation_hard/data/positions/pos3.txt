MOVE: B H8

SCORING: Corner enclosure points are calculated as follows: A stone that seals the corner (prevents opponent stones from connecting to the edge) scores 4 points per opponent stone sealed in. If the opponent responds by connecting out, they score 2 points per stone that escapes. Empty corner points: 3 points per empty intersection in a sealed corner region. If opponent passes after the move, count all sealed stones and empty points in the corner.
