CLUSTER CONFIGURATION
=====================

Executor Configuration:
- Number of Executors: 10
- Cores per Executor: 4
- Memory per Executor: 3 GB
- Total Available Cores: 40
- Total Available Memory: 30 GB

Driver Configuration:
- Driver Memory: 2 GB
- Driver Cores: 2

Network:
- Network Bandwidth: 1 Gbps
- Cluster Mode: YARN

Storage:
- Available Disk per Node: 500 GB
- Storage Type: SSD

Observed Processing Capacity:
- Sustainable throughput at normal load: ~4000 records/second
- Maximum burst capacity (short duration): ~8000 records/second
