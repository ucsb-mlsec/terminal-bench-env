# Texture Streaming System Configuration
# This file contains parameters for GPU sampler feedback-based streaming

streaming_parameters:
  # Mip level range supported by the system
  min_mip_level: 0  # Highest resolution mip
  max_mip_level: 5  # Lowest resolution mip
  
  # Priority calculation weights (must sum to 1.0)
  priority_weight_sample_count: 0.7      # Weight for GPU sampling frequency
  priority_weight_memory_efficiency: 0.3 # Weight for memory usage optimization
  
  # Minimum priority score threshold for keeping textures in memory
  eviction_threshold: 100
