VULKAN DESCRIPTOR SET LAYOUT VALIDATION RULES
=======================================================

Rule 1: BINDING UNIQUENESS WITHIN SETS
Binding numbers within a single descriptor set must be unique. Each binding in a set must have a distinct binding number. The same binding number can be reused across different descriptor sets (e.g., set_0 binding 0 and set_1 binding 0 are valid).

Rule 2: BINDING NUMBER RANGES
Binding numbers can be non-consecutive and can start at any non-negative integer. Valid binding numbers range from 0 to the implementation's maximum (typically at least 0-31 are guaranteed).

Rule 3: UNIFORM_BUFFER DESCRIPTOR TYPE
UNIFORM_BUFFER descriptors are used for read-only uniform data accessed by shaders. This type is appropriate for small, frequently accessed data structures like transformation matrices, material properties, and lighting parameters.

Rule 4: STORAGE_BUFFER DESCRIPTOR TYPE
STORAGE_BUFFER descriptors provide read-write access to buffer data. This type is primarily used in compute shaders for general-purpose GPU computing operations and must not be confused with UNIFORM_BUFFER.

Rule 5: COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER DESCRIPTOR TYPE
COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER combines a texture image and sampler into a single descriptor. This is the most common descriptor type for texture sampling operations in shaders.

Rule 6: SAMPLED_IMAGE AND SEPARATE SAMPLERS
SAMPLED_IMAGE descriptors represent textures without an integrated sampler. When using SAMPLED_IMAGE, a separate SAMPLER descriptor must be provided for texture sampling operations.

Rule 7: STORAGE_IMAGE DESCRIPTOR TYPE
STORAGE_IMAGE descriptors allow read-write access to images in compute shaders. This type enables image load/store operations and is distinct from SAMPLED_IMAGE which is read-only.

Rule 8: SHADER STAGE FLAG COMPLETENESS
The stages field must include ALL shader stages that access the resource. Missing even one required stage flag will cause validation errors or undefined behavior. If a resource is accessed by both vertex and fragment shaders, the stages must be "VERTEX|FRAGMENT".

Rule 9: VALID SHADER STAGE IDENTIFIERS
Valid shader stage identifiers are: VERTEX, FRAGMENT, COMPUTE, GEOMETRY, TESSELLATION_CONTROL, and TESSELLATION_EVALUATION. Stage flags are case-sensitive and must match these exact names.

Rule 10: MULTIPLE STAGE FLAG SYNTAX
When a resource is accessed by multiple shader stages, combine stage flags using the pipe separator (|) with no spaces. Example: "VERTEX|FRAGMENT" or "VERTEX|GEOMETRY|FRAGMENT".

Rule 11: DESCRIPTOR TYPE MATCHING
The descriptor type specified in the layout must exactly match what the shader code expects. A shader declaring a uniform buffer cannot use a STORAGE_BUFFER descriptor, and vice versa.

Rule 12: COMPUTE STAGE EXCLUSIVITY
Compute shaders execute in a separate pipeline from graphics shaders. COMPUTE stage flags should not be combined with VERTEX, FRAGMENT, GEOMETRY, or tessellation stages as they belong to different pipeline types.

Rule 13: RESOURCE COMPLETENESS
Every resource declared and used in shader code must have a corresponding descriptor binding in the layout. Missing descriptors will cause validation errors during pipeline creation.

Rule 14: DESCRIPTOR SET ORGANIZATION
Descriptor sets should be organized by update frequency: set_0 for resources that change rarely (e.g., per-application), set_1 for resources that change per-frame, set_2 for resources that change per-material, and set_3 for resources that change per-draw call.

Rule 15: DESCRIPTOR COUNT SPECIFICATION
Each binding implicitly has a descriptor count. For single resources, the count is 1. For arrays of resources, the count must match the array size declared in the shader.

Rule 16: TEXEL BUFFER TYPES
UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER and STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER are specialized descriptor types for buffer textures. UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER is read-only, while STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER allows read-write access.

Rule 17: TYPE CONSISTENCY ACROSS SETS
While the same binding number can appear in different sets, ensure logical consistency in how descriptor types are used across the application to avoid confusion during development.

Rule 18: FRAGMENT SHADER TEXTURE ACCESS
Texture sampling operations (using COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER or SAMPLED_IMAGE) in fragment shaders must have the FRAGMENT stage flag set. This is one of the most common sources of descriptor layout errors.
