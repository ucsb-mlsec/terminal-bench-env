=== Dataset Directory Structure ===

Location: /workspace/dataset/
Total files: 200 placeholder images
Naming convention: image_001.jpg through image_200.jpg
File size: Approximately 1KB each (placeholder data)
Purpose: Testing DataLoader configuration and training pipeline

These placeholder image files simulate a real dataset for performance testing.
The actual training script at /workspace/train.py loads these files using PyTorch DataLoader.
Each file represents a small image sample used to evaluate data loading efficiency.
