The LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO_64 load command indicates this binary is encrypted with cryptid=1. In a real encrypted binary, the __TEXT segment would contain encrypted code that can only be decrypted by Apple's FairPlay system at runtime on authorized devices. This binary represents an App Store distributed application that has not been decrypted. Security researchers would need to decrypt this using tools like Clutch, frida-ios-dump, or similar utilities before they could perform static analysis or reverse engineering. The encryption protects the application's intellectual property and makes it more difficult to analyze or modify the code. When loaded on an iOS device, the dynamic linker (dyld) checks the cryptid field and coordinates with the kernel to decrypt the binary in memory during the loading process._main_printf_puts_NSLog_objc_msgSend_objc_release_UIApplicationMain_dispatch_async_dispatch_get_main_queuecom.google.ios.youtubeYouTube for iOSVersion 18.45.3com.apple.fairplay.encryptedAPPLE_FAIRPLAY_DRM_PROTECTEDARM64_BINARY_ENCRYPTEDThis section contains encrypted application code and data that is protected by Apple's FairPlay Digital Rights Management system0x1000000000x200000001ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD_MARKER_STARTThe actual application code would be encrypted here using AES encryption as part of Apple's FairPlay DRM implementation ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD_MARKER_ENDAdditional binary metadata and code signatures would appear in the LINKEDIT segment
