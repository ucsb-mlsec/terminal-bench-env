Silicon Band Structure Calculation - Project Notes
==========================================================

Date: October 15, 2024

Project: Electronic structure calculations for Si using DFT
Software: Quantum ESPRESSO v7.1

Calculation Details:
-------------------
- Running standard silicon band structure calculations using LDA functional
- Using norm-conserving pseudopotential for Si (Si.pz-vbc.UPF from the QE library)
- Diamond/FCC crystal structure with experimental lattice parameter a = 10.26 Bohr
- Both SCF (self-consistent field) and NSCF (band structure) calculations completed successfully

Setup:
- First ran scf calculation to get ground state charge density
- Then ran nscf calculation along high-symmetry k-path (L-Gamma-X) for band structure
- Energy cutoff: 18 Ry (should be sufficient for norm-conserving PP)
- k-point mesh: 8x8x8 for SCF, path with ~40 points for bands

Results Location:
- Output files saved in the qe_outputs subdirectory under data
- SCF output: silicon.scf.out
- Band structure output: silicon.bands.out

Notes:
- Expecting LDA to significantly underestimate experimental bandgap (~1.1 eV)
- Typical LDA Si bandgap should be around 0.5-0.7 eV
- Remember: QE outputs energies in Rydberg, need to convert to eV for reporting
- Fermi energy from SCF calculation needed to reference band energies

Status: Calculations completed successfully last month by Marco (postdoc). 
Marco left for new position at SLAC before finishing analysis. Need to extract
bandgap value from existing outputs for upcoming grant renewal.
