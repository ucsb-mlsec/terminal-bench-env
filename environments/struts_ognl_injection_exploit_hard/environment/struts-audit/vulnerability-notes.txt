Internal Security Notes - Struts Application Audit
================================================================

Date: March 2023
Auditor: Security Team

Application Details:
- Framework: Apache Struts 2.3.31
- Last major update: Early 2017
- Production deployment: March 2017

Concerns Identified:
- Application hasn't been patched since initial deployment in 2017
- Using older 2.3.x branch - support ended years ago
- Several security advisories released in 2017-2018 timeframe

Configuration Notes:
- Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) appears to be enabled in struts.xml
- Multiple redirect actions using namespace wildcards
- Namespace handling uses dynamic parameters for flexibility
- URL patterns configured with wildcard namespace matching

Recent Findings:
- Team noticed redirect functionality accepts user-controlled namespace values
- RedirectAction implementation passes namespace and actionName from request
- No input validation on namespace parameter before redirect processing
- Potential for malicious OGNL injection through redirect parameters

Security Advisories Review:
- Multiple CVEs published in 2017-2018 affecting 2.3.x branch
- Specific concerns about namespace handling vulnerabilities (S2-057)
- Advisory mentioned OGNL injection via namespace manipulation
- Uncertain if patches for 2018 advisories were ever applied
- Need to verify CVE-2018-11776 applicability

Action Items:
- Review all redirect actions for unsafe parameter handling
- Check if namespace parameter validation exists
- Consider upgrade to Struts 2.5.x (latest patched version)
