THEOREM: If A implies B, then not-B implies not-A

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. A → B

STEPS:
1. Assume A → B (from assumption 1)
2. Assume ¬B (for conditional proof)
3. From A → B, we can derive A (by modus ponens)
4. Since we have A and A → B, we get B
5. We now have both B and ¬B, which is a contradiction
6. Therefore, our assumption must be wrong, so ¬A must hold
7. Thus, ¬B → ¬A

CONCLUSION: ¬B → ¬A
