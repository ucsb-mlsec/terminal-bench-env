THEOREM: If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. A implies B
2. B implies C

STEPS:
1. Assume A is true (hypothesis)
2. From Step 1 and Assumption 1, B is true (modus ponens)
3. From Step 2 and Assumption 2, C is true (modus ponens)
4. Therefore, if A is true, then C is true (conditional proof from Steps 1-3)

CONCLUSION: A implies C
