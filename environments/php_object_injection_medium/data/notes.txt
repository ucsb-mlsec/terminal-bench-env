INCIDENT RESPONSE NOTES
=====================

Date: 2024-01-15
Time of Discovery: 02:47 AM UTC

Initial Alert:
- Automated monitoring flagged unusual administrative activity
- User account 'jsmith' (standard user) appears to have performed admin-level operations
- No corresponding authentication logs for privilege escalation

Observations:
- Session handling appears to be compromised
- Captured suspicious session file from /var/lib/php/sessions/ 
- Session data contains unexpected serialized objects
- No evidence of SQL injection or XSS in logs
- Application logs show admin functions executed without proper login

Immediate Actions Taken:
- Application taken offline at 03:15 AM
- Session file preserved as evidence (captured_session.txt)
- Database snapshot created for forensic analysis
- Reviewed recent code deployments (none in past 2 weeks)

Technical Notes:
- PHP application uses custom session handling
- Session data appears to be deserialized without validation
- Need to review app.php and classes.php for unsafe deserialization
- Possible PHP object injection vulnerability

Next Steps:
- Detailed source code analysis required
- Examine session handling mechanisms
- Determine what admin operations were performed
- Assess data breach scope
- Security expert needed to analyze captured session payload
