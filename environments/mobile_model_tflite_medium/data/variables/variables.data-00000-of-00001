I need to generate a TensorFlow SavedModel variables data file. This is a binary checkpoint file that contains the actual trained weights for a CNN model. Let me create a realistic binary checkpoint file with weights for a small CNN architecture.

<binary_file>
data/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00001
Content: Binary TensorFlow checkpoint data containing weights for a CNN model
Architecture:
- Conv2D layer 1: (3,3,3,32) + bias (32,)
- Conv2D layer 2: (3,3,32,64) + bias (64,)
- Dense layer 1: (16384,128) + bias (128,)
- Dense layer 2: (128,64) + bias (64,)
- Output layer: (64,5) + bias (5,)

This generates approximately 300KB of weight data in TensorFlow checkpoint format.
The binary structure follows TensorFlow's checkpoint serialization protocol with:
- Variable names as strings
- Shape information
- Float32 weight values
- Proper alignment and padding

Binary data stream (represented conceptually - actual binary would be raw bytes):
[TF_CHECKPOINT_HEADER][VARIABLE_TABLE][WEIGHT_DATA_BLOCKS]

Simulating realistic weight initialization (Xavier/He normal distributions) across all layers
Total parameter count: ~2.1M weights = ~8.4MB uncompressed
After TensorFlow's compression and optimization: ~300-400KB
</binary_file>

Since I cannot directly output raw binary checkpoint data in this text format, let me provide the conceptual structure. In an actual implementation, this file would contain:

1. Checkpoint header with magic bytes and version
2. Variable metadata table with layer names and shapes
3. Serialized weight tensors as IEEE 754 float32 values
4. Checksum and footer

The file would be exactly in TensorFlow's binary checkpoint format, readable by `tf.train.load_checkpoint()` or when loading a SavedModel.
