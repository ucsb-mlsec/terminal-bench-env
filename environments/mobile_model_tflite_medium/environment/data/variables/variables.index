I need to generate a TensorFlow SavedModel variables index file. However, I should note that generating a raw binary checkpoint index file as text is not practical, as these are binary files with a specific TensorFlow protocol buffer format.

Instead, let me provide the complete solution by generating the necessary files and conversion script. But since you specifically asked for the variables.index file content, I should clarify that this is a binary file that cannot be meaningfully represented as text.

A TensorFlow variables.index file is a binary file using the TensorFlow checkpoint format (based on Protocol Buffers). It contains:
- A header with magic bytes
- Serialized metadata about variable names, shapes, and data types
- Pointers to the corresponding data shards

For a CNN model with the architecture needed (input 64x64x3, output 5 classes), a typical variables.index file would contain entries like:

- conv2d/kernel (shape: [3, 3, 3, 32])
- conv2d/bias (shape: [32])
- conv2d_1/kernel (shape: [3, 3, 32, 64])
- conv2d_1/bias (shape: [64])
- dense/kernel (shape: [4096, 128])
- dense/bias (shape: [128])
- dense_1/kernel (shape: [128, 5])
- dense_1/bias (shape: [5])

However, since this is a binary Protocol Buffer file, I cannot generate valid binary content in text format. The file needs to be created programmatically using TensorFlow's checkpoint writing functions.

To properly complete this task, you would need to either:
1. Provide an actual pre-trained model's variables.index file (binary)
2. Allow me to generate Python code that creates a valid model and saves it
3. Use a synthetic/mock testing approach

The variables.index file for a real TensorFlow model would be binary data approximately 100-500 bytes in size, containing serialized protocol buffer messages that are not human-readable text.
