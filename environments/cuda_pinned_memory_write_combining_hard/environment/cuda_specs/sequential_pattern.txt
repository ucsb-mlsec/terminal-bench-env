PATTERN NAME: Sequential Write Pattern

MEMORY ACCESS SEQUENCE:
- Buffer size: 64 MB (67108864 bytes)
- Access pattern: Sequential writes from byte 0 to byte 67108863
- Write order: Addresses are accessed in strictly increasing order: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...
- Write size: 4-byte (32-bit) writes aligned on 4-byte boundaries
- Total number of writes: 16777216 writes
- No read operations are performed on the buffer before data transfer to GPU
- Write operations are performed exactly once per location
- No interleaving or out-of-order access

BUFFER ALIGNMENT:
- Buffer is allocated with 256-byte alignment
- Starting address is guaranteed to be aligned on 256-byte boundary
- All writes are naturally aligned (4-byte writes on 4-byte boundaries)
- Alignment satisfies all CUDA memory requirements
- Buffer address modulo 256 equals 0

CURRENT MEMORY ALLOCATION:
- Using standard pinned memory (cudaHostAlloc with cudaHostAllocDefault flag)
- Memory is cacheable
- CPU cache is utilized during write operations
- Cache lines are 64 bytes on target architecture
- Write-allocate cache policy in effect

OBSERVED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Current throughput: 3.2 GB/s write bandwidth
- Cache hit rate: High (approximately 95%)
- Write pattern exhibits excellent spatial locality
- No write-after-read dependencies
- No read-modify-write operations
- Data is written once and then transferred to GPU immediately
- CPU writes traverse L1/L2/L3 cache hierarchy
- Memory traffic includes cache coherency overhead
- Write operations incur cache line allocation overhead

USE CASE:
- Image preprocessing: Converting raw camera data to GPU-processable format
- Data flows from camera buffer → CPU pinned buffer → GPU device memory
- CPU performs sequential format conversion and writes results sequentially
- Typical operation: Read from camera DMA buffer, convert pixel format, write to pinned buffer
- No requirement to read back data once written
- Buffer is consumed by cudaMemcpy immediately after writes complete
- Time-critical path in real-time video processing pipeline
