I'll analyze the Go boards to find stones in atari (with exactly one liberty). Let me start by reading the board files and implementing the solution.

<solve>
import os
from collections import deque

def read_board(filepath):
    """Read a board from file and return as 2D list."""
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    return [list(line.strip()) for line in lines if line.strip()]

def get_neighbors(row, col, size=9):
    """Get valid neighboring coordinates."""
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
        if 0 <= nr < size and 0 <= nc < size:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors

def find_group(board, row, col, visited):
    """Find all stones in a connected group using BFS."""
    color = board[row][col]
    if color == '.':
        return set()
    
    group = set()
    queue = deque([(row, col)])
    group.add((row, col))
    
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c):
            if (nr, nc) not in group and board[nr][nc] == color:
                group.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    
    return group

def count_liberties(board, group):
    """Count liberties for a group of stones."""
    liberties = set()
    for r, c in group:
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c):
            if board[nr][nc] == '.':
                liberties.add((nr, nc))
    return len(liberties)

def find_atari_stones(board):
    """Find all stones that have exactly one liberty."""
    visited = set()
    atari_stones = []
    
    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            if board[row][col] in ['B', 'W'] and (row, col) not in visited:
                group = find_group(board, row, col, visited)
                visited.update(group)
                
                if count_liberties(board, group) == 1:
                    # All stones in this group are in atari
                    for r, c in group:
                        atari_stones.append((r + 1, c + 1, board[r][c]))  # Convert to 1-indexed
    
    return atari_stones

# Process all board files
boards_dir = '/home/agent/boards/'
results = []

for i in range(1, 16):
    filename = f'board_{i:02d}.txt'
    filepath = os.path.join(boards_dir, filename)
    
    if os.path.exists(filepath):
        board = read_board(filepath)
        atari_stones = find_atari_stones(board)
        
        for row, col, color in atari_stones:
            results.append((filename, row, col, color))

# Sort results by board name, then row, then column
results.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2]))

# Write output
with open('/home/agent/atari_stones.txt', 'w') as f:
    for filename, row, col, color in results:
        f.write(f'{filename} {row} {col} {color}\n')
</solve>
