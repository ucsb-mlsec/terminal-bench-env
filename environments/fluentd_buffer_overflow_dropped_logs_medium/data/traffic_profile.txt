Production Traffic Profile - Log Volume Analysis
================================================================

Report Date: 2024-01-15
Environment: Production Cluster
Monitoring Period: 30 days (Dec 15, 2023 - Jan 14, 2024)

OVERALL TRAFFIC STATISTICS
================================================================
Average logs per second (normal hours): 2,000-3,000 logs/sec
Peak traffic (business hours): 8,000-12,000 logs/sec
Peak duration: typically 2-4 hours (11:00-15:00 UTC)
Average log entry size: 512 bytes
Peak log entry size: up to 2KB for detailed audit logs

BREAKDOWN BY LOG TYPE
================================================================
Application logs (app.**):
  - Volume: 60% of total traffic
  - Average entry size: 800 bytes per entry
  - Peak rate: ~7,200 logs/sec during afternoon peak

System metrics (system.**):
  - Volume: 25% of total traffic
  - Average entry size: 256 bytes per entry
  - Peak rate: ~3,000 logs/sec during afternoon peak

Audit logs (audit.**):
  - Volume: 15% of total traffic
  - Average entry size: 1.5KB per entry
  - Peak rate: ~1,800 logs/sec during afternoon peak

DAILY TRAFFIC PATTERNS
================================================================
Morning spike: 08:00-09:00 UTC (3x normal baseline)
  - Typical rate: 6,000-9,000 logs/sec

Lunch peak: 11:00-13:00 UTC (4x normal baseline)
  - Typical rate: 8,000-12,000 logs/sec

Afternoon peak: 14:00-16:00 UTC (5x normal baseline - HIGHEST LOAD)
  - Typical rate: 10,000-15,000 logs/sec
  - This is the critical period for buffer sizing

Evening decline: after 18:00 UTC (0.5x normal baseline)
  - Typical rate: 1,000-1,500 logs/sec

Overnight: 22:00-06:00 UTC (0.2x normal baseline)
  - Typical rate: 400-600 logs/sec

BURST CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================
Sudden traffic bursts can reach 15,000 logs/sec for 30-60 seconds
These bursts occur 3-5 times per day during peak hours
Bursts are typically triggered by:
  - Batch job completions
  - Automated deployment processes
  - Database maintenance operations

MEMORY CONSTRAINTS
================================================================
Total buffer memory allocation must not exceed 512MB across all buffers
Recommended: allocate more to high-volume app logs, less to audit logs
Suggested distribution:
  - Application logs: ~60% of buffer memory (307MB)
  - System metrics: ~25% of buffer memory (128MB)
  - Audit logs: ~15% of buffer memory (77MB)

RETENTION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================
Buffers should hold at least 5 minutes of peak traffic to handle downstream slowdowns
No log loss is acceptable during normal peak periods
Buffer overflow protection is critical during burst events
