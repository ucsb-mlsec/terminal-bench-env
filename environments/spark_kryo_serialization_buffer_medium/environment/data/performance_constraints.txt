PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS AND SYSTEM LIMITS
=============================================

MEMORY CONSTRAINTS
------------------
• Executor memory limit: 8GB per executor
• Maximum serialization buffer overhead: 10% of executor memory (800MB max per executor)
• Total buffer allocation across all tasks must not exceed 800MB per executor
• Minimum available heap after buffer allocation: 7.2GB per executor

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
------------------------
• Serialization overhead must be less than 5% of total job execution time
• Buffer initialization time: <100ms per task
• Buffer growth operations should minimize reallocation (target: <3 growth operations per object)
• No performance degradation for objects under 10MB

SYSTEM LIMITS
-------------
• JVM heap size: 8GB per executor
• Maximum single buffer allocation: 512MB (prevents OOM risk)
• Concurrent tasks per executor: 4
• Maximum buffer size per task: 512MB

OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
-----------------------
• Must support serialization of objects up to 450MB in size
• Buffer growth must be automatic (no manual intervention)
• Initial buffer size should be reasonable: 32k-128k range preferred
• Avoid pre-allocating large buffers that waste memory for small objects
