Pattern: Multi-stream synchronization with events. The code launches kernelA on stream1, records a CUDA event using cudaEventRecord() on stream1, then launches kernelB on stream2. To create a dependency, it uses cudaStreamWaitEvent() to make stream2 wait for the event recorded on stream1, and finally launches kernelC on stream2. No CPU synchronization calls like cudaStreamSynchronize() or cudaEventSynchronize() are used - only stream-to-stream dependencies are established via cudaEventRecord() and cudaStreamWaitEvent(). This creates a dependency graph where kernelC waits for kernelA to complete before executing, while kernelB can run independently.
