# Update authentication system documentation

## Description

The authentication system has undergone significant changes in the last quarter, and we need to update all related documentation to reflect the new OAuth2 implementation and multi-factor authentication features.

## Tasks

- [ ] Review current authentication flow
- [ ] Document new OAuth2 endpoints
- [ ] Update API reference guide
- [ ] Add MFA setup instructions
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users

## Notes

This documentation is critical for the Q2 developer onboarding process. The technical writing team should be consulted for consistency with existing documentation standards.
