# Update API documentation for new endpoints

## Description

The recent API updates introduced several new endpoints that need to be properly documented. This includes:

- User authentication endpoints
- Data export functionality
- Webhook configuration options

## Acceptance Criteria

- All new endpoints are documented with request/response examples
- Authentication requirements are clearly specified
- Common error codes and their meanings are included
- Code samples provided in at least 3 programming languages

## Notes

Coordinate with the backend team to ensure all endpoint specifications are accurate. The documentation should be published to the developer portal once completed.
