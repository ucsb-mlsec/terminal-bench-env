BLAST Model Checker v2.7.3
=====================================
Starting verification session...
Input file: /workspace/programs/buffer_check.c
Property: Memory safety (buffer overflow detection)

Initializing abstract reachability tree...
Computing initial abstraction...

[Iteration 1]
Exploring abstract state space...
Abstract counterexample found, checking feasibility...
Counterexample is spurious, refining abstraction...

Computing interpolants for refinement:
Interpolant at location 1: ptr != NULL
Interpolant at location 2: size > 0
Interpolant at location 3: index < size
Interpolant at location 4: buffer_allocated == 1
Interpolant at location 5: offset >= 0
Interpolant at location 6: length <= MAX_SIZE
Interpolant at location 7: capacity > index
Interpolant at location 8: data != NULL
Interpolant at location 9: count <= capacity

[Iteration 2]
Refining abstraction with new predicates...
Exploring refined state space...
No abstract counterexample found in refined abstraction.
