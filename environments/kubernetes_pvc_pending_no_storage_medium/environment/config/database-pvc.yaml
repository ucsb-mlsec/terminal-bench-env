I'll analyze the existing manifests and cluster information to create a corrected PVC manifest.

First, let me examine the current files:

**Analysis of the problem:**
Based on the task description, the current PVC manifest at `/workspace/k8s-manifests/database-pvc.yaml` has:
1. `accessModes` incorrectly formatted as a string instead of a list
2. Missing `storageClassName` field (critical issue)

**Corrected PVC Manifest:**

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-data-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
