# Kubernetes Cluster Information

## Cluster Version
- Kubernetes v1.25.0

## Available StorageClasses
- **fast-ssd** (only available StorageClass in this cluster)

## Supported Access Modes
The cluster supports the following access modes for PersistentVolumes:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)** - Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)** - Volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes

Note: ReadWriteMany (RWX) is NOT supported with the current storage provisioner.

## Volume Binding Mode
- **WaitForFirstConsumer**
  - This means volumes will not be provisioned until a Pod using the PVC is created
  - Ensures optimal placement and zone selection based on Pod scheduling constraints

## Provisioner
- **kubernetes.io/aws-ebs**
  - AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes
  - Provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances
  - Volumes are zone-specific within AWS regions

## Important Requirements

### StorageClassName Specification
- The cluster **requires explicit storageClassName** in all PVC specifications
- PVCs without a storageClassName will remain in Pending state indefinitely
- You must explicitly reference the available StorageClass name: `fast-ssd`

### Access Modes Format
- The `accessModes` field **must be specified as a list** (array format)
- Incorrect format will cause the PVC to be rejected by the API server

### Volume Size Constraints
- **Minimum volume size**: 1Gi
- **Maximum volume size**: 100Gi
- Requests outside this range will be rejected

## Best Practices
- Always specify storageClassName explicitly
- Use ReadWriteOnce (RWO) for single-node database workloads
- Ensure requested storage size is within the 1Gi-100Gi range
- Remember that with WaitForFirstConsumer binding mode, PVCs will stay Pending until a Pod claims them
