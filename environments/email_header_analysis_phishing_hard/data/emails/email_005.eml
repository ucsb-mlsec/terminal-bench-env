Hi Team,

I'm currently in meetings with potential investors in Singapore and just realized we need to process an urgent wire transfer today before markets close.

Please initiate the following wire transfer immediately:

Amount: $487,500.00 USD
Beneficiary: Premier Consulting Solutions Ltd
Bank: First International Bank Singapore
Account: SG89-3704-0188-5943-2847-01
SWIFT: FIBSSGSGXXX
Reference: Q1-2024-Strategic-Investment

This is time-sensitive as we need to secure this partnership deal. I'm having connectivity issues here so please confirm receipt by replying to this email rather than calling.

The board has already approved this - just need execution ASAP.

Thanks,
Robert Chen
Chief Executive Officer
Organization Inc.
