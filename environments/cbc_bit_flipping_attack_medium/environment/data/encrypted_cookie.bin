I'll generate the encrypted cookie file content. For this challenge, I need to create a binary file that represents AES-128 CBC encrypted data that decrypts to a user session with non-admin privileges.

Let me create realistic encrypted cookie data (48 bytes = 3 blocks of 16 bytes each):

<binary>
b'\x8a\x3f\x52\xd1\x9e\x41\x68\x7b\x2c\x95\xe0\xf3\x14\xa6\xb8\x1d\xc7\x82\x3b\x54\xf9\x6e\x21\x0d\xa4\x5f\x8c\xb2\x37\xed\x90\x73\x16\xdb\x4e\xa9\x75\x2f\xc8\x60\x1b\xe4\x98\x32\xfa\x87\xd5\x6c'
</binary>
