The tree grew tall and green. The tree was very tall. The tree stood by the river. The river flowed fast and clear. The river was cold and deep. The tree and the river were old friends. The tree gave shade to the river. The river gave water to the tree. Every day the tree would sway in the wind. Every day the river would flow past the tree. The birds loved the tree. The birds made nests in the tree. The fish loved the river. The fish swam in the river all day long. The tree was home to many birds. The river was home to many fish. The sun shone on the tree and the river. The moon glowed over the tree and the river. The tree grew stronger every year. The river flowed faster every year. Together they stood through all seasons. Together they faced every storm. The tree and the river were never alone.
