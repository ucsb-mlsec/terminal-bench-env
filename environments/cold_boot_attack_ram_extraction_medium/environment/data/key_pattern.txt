AES-256 Encryption Key Pattern
================================

Key Length: 256 bits (32 bytes)

Key Structure:
- Bytes 0-3: Signature header (0x4B 0x45 0x59 0x21) - ASCII "KEY!"
- Bytes 4-7: Version bytes (0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00)
- Bytes 8-15: Timestamp-derived bytes (alternating pattern)
- Bytes 16-31: Cryptographic material (pseudo-random but with even parity on each byte)

Validation Rules:
1. First 4 bytes must match signature (4B 45 59 21)
2. Bytes 4-7 represent version (currently 01 00 00 00)
3. Each byte in positions 16-31 must have even parity (even number of 1-bits)

Cold Boot Attack Considerations:
- Expect 0-5 bit flips in the recovered key
- Bit decay pattern: bits are more likely to decay to 0 than to 1
- Priority correction: signature bytes are most critical for identification

Example valid key (hex):
