MOVE: B C5

SCORING: Connected edge groups score 3 points per stone in the group. Disconnected stones score 0 points. If White responds at C5, Black's stones at C4 and C6 remain disconnected (0 points each). If White passes, Black plays C5 and connects both stones into one group with the edge stone, forming a 3-stone connected group (9 points total). White's position: Currently W at E4, E6, and B7 form separate groups. Connection value applies only to groups that include at least one edge position (rows 1, 9 or columns A, I).
