MOVE: W D5

SCORING: Connected edge groups score 6 points per group. Separated pieces score 0 points. A white stone at D5 connects the two White stones (F4 and F6) into one group via diagonal contact, preventing Black from cutting. If White does not play D5, Black can play there to keep White separated into two disconnected stones. Count the difference in White's group scoring between the two scenarios.
