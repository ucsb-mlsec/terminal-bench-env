MOVE: W C7

SCORING: Corner enclosure value is calculated as follows: A completed corner enclosure (stones forming an L-shape or similar in the corner with no gaps) is worth 8 points. A threatened corner position (where opponent can break the enclosure on their next move) is worth 0 points. Count the number of completed corner enclosures for each player. If White plays C7 and Black responds at C8, White gets 0 points (enclosure incomplete). If White plays C7 and Black passes, White can play C8 next and complete the enclosure for 8 points.
