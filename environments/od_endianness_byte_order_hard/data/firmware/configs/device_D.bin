I'll create the binary file content for device_D.bin with values written in the wrong endianness.

Based on the requirements, I'll assume device_D is natively little-endian (as most embedded devices are), so I'll write the data in big-endian format to create the corruption.

Values to encode (in correct endianness):
- Network address: 192168001 (0x0B7698C1)
- Port: 8080 (0x1F90)
- Power: 12.5 watts (IEEE 754: 0x41480000)
- Interval: 3600 seconds (0x00000E10)

Writing these in big-endian (wrong endianness for a little-endian device):

Network address 192168001 as big-endian 32-bit: 0x0B 0x76 0x98 0xC1
Port 8080 as big-endian 16-bit: 0x1F 0x90
Power 12.5 as big-endian 32-bit float: 0x41 0x48 0x00 0x00
Interval 3600 as big-endian 32-bit: 0x00 0x00 0x0E 0x10

Total: 14 bytes
