I'll create the binary file for device_A.bin with values written in the wrong endianness.

Let me construct the binary data with these values (assuming the device should be little-endian, so I'll write in big-endian):

- device_id: 1500 (0x05DC) - as big-endian: 0x05 0xDC
- temperature: 85 (0x00000055) - as big-endian: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x55
- voltage: 3.3 (float) - as big-endian: 0x40 0x53 0x33 0x33
- version: 2048 (0x0800) - as big-endian: 0x08 0x00

The binary content (12 bytes total):
