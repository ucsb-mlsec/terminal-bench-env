Initramfs Template Directory
========================================

Purpose
-------
This directory contains templates and examples for building custom initramfs
images for embedded Linux systems. The templates provide a starting point for
creating initramfs configurations tailored to specific hardware and boot
requirements.

Directory Structure
-------------------
The template directory is organized as follows:

- init-skeleton: Sample init script to customize for your specific boot
  requirements. This serves as the primary initialization script that runs
  during early boot.

- modules/: Directory containing list of available kernel modules that can
  be included in the initramfs image. Review these to determine which modules
  are needed for your hardware configuration.

- configs/: Example configuration files from deployed systems. These provide
  reference implementations for common use cases and can be adapted to your
  specific needs.

Configuration File Format
-------------------------
Build configuration files should follow this format:

- Use module=<name> for kernel modules (without .ko extension)
  Example: module=ext4

- Use script=<path> for scripts to include in the initramfs
  Example: script=/init

- Use compression=<type> for compression method (gzip, xz, lzma)
  Example: compression=gzip

Each directive should be on its own line in the configuration file.

Notes
-----
- Module names should match those listed in modules/available-modules.txt

- Required modules depend on your specific hardware configuration, including
  storage controllers, filesystem types, and network adapters

- Check example configs in the configs/ directory for reference implementations

- Ensure all dependencies for selected modules are also included
