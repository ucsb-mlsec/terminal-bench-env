NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS:
================================================================================
CRITICAL: Disk I/O contention appears severe with multiple concurrent git 
housekeeping operations (30 combined git-gc and git-repack processes). The 
disk subsystem is saturated at 95-100% utilization with extremely high iowait 
(35-45%). This level of concurrent garbage collection and repository 
maintenance is causing significant performance degradation. Repository 
synchronization operations are likely queued behind these housekeeping tasks, 
leading to extended delays. Recommend immediate review of git housekeeping 
schedule and concurrency limits.
