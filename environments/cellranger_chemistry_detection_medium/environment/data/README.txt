Single-Cell RNA-Seq Dataset - SC2023-B47
================================================

Dataset ID: SC2023-B47
Sample Type: Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)
Collection Date: 2023-09-15
Sequencing Date: 2023-09-18
Platform: Illumina NovaSeq 6000

File Information:
-----------------
Number of FASTQ pairs: 4
Naming convention: sample[1-4]_R1.fastq.gz, sample[1-4]_R2.fastq.gz
Total size: ~2.3 GB compressed

Chemistry Version: UNSPECIFIED
-------------------------------
The chemistry version used for library preparation was not recorded in the
submission metadata. Automated pipeline processing has failed. Manual
inspection required to determine barcode/UMI structure.

Known Issues:
-------------
- Chemistry version metadata missing from sequencing run
- Standard auto-detection failed during initial QC
- Files appear structurally valid (passed FASTQ format validation)

Notes: Samples were processed by external core facility. Contact requested
for library prep protocol details but response pending.
