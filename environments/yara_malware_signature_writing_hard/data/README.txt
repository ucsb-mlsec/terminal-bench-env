OPERATION PHANTOMCORE - INCIDENT BRIEFING
Incident ID: SEC-2024-0147
Classification: HIGH SEVERITY

CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW:
Operation PhantomCore is a sophisticated, ongoing phishing campaign that has successfully compromised 25 corporate workstations across our Finance, HR, and IT departments over the past two weeks. The threat actors demonstrate advanced knowledge of corporate infrastructure and employ multi-layered evasion techniques designed to bypass standard security controls.

INITIAL INFECTION VECTOR:
The campaign begins with targeted spear-phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents. These documents exploit macro-based vulnerabilities and employ social engineering tactics themed around urgent financial requests and policy updates. Upon execution, the malicious payload is silently deployed while displaying a decoy document to the victim.

PERSISTENCE MECHANISMS:
PhantomCore establishes multiple persistence footholds including registry Run keys under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and scheduled tasks masquerading as Windows Update services. The malware drops executables in %APPDATA%\Local and %TEMP% directories with names closely resembling legitimate Windows processes.

COMMAND AND CONTROL:
Network analysis reveals HTTP/HTTPS communications to multiple backup C2 domains on non-standard ports (8443, 8080, 4443). The malware employs custom user agents and beacons at 30-60 minute intervals to evade detection. Domain generation algorithms provide fallback communication channels.

EVASION TECHNIQUES:
The malware demonstrates sophisticated evasion through process name typosquatting (svchost32.exe, csrss32.exe, lsass32.exe instead of legitimate Windows processes). Mutex objects with specific naming patterns prevent duplicate infections. File timestamps are manipulated to blend with system files.

DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS:
Key indicators include: deliberate typos in process names (32-bit suffix on 64-bit systems), registry keys with unusual timestamp patterns, files in AppData with system-level naming conventions, and network connections to legitimate-looking domains on unusual ports. These patterns rarely occur in legitimate software and provide high-confidence detection opportunities when correlated.
