I need to create a shared library that is intentionally incompatible (old version) with the analyzer binary. This library should have some mathematical functions but be missing symbols or have version mismatches that would occur when a system upgrade rebuilds the application but not the library.

Here's the content for `/usr/local/lib/libmathcore.so.1` - I'll provide this as a compiled ELF shared object with intentional compatibility issues:

Since I cannot directly generate a binary ELF file in text format, I'll create a C source file that represents the OLD version of the library (before the system upgrade) that would be compiled into libmathcore.so.1. This old version would be missing symbols that the upgraded analyzer expects.

However, the task asks me to generate the file content for the EXISTING incompatible library. Since this is a binary file, I should instead provide context about what would be in this file and focus on the solution approach.

Let me reconsider: The task is asking me to generate the content of an existing OLD library file that is causing the problem. Since this needs to be an actual binary shared library file, and I need to output actual file content, I'll create a minimal ELF shared object structure.

But actually, looking at the task more carefully, it seems I should generate the OLD library content that represents the problematic state. Since I cannot output raw binary data directly, let me provide the C source that would have been compiled into this old, incompatible version:

/* Old version of libmathcore - compiled before system upgrade */
/* Missing compute_stddev function that new analyzer expects */
/* Has incompatible function signatures */

#include <stdio.h>

/* Old version - returns float instead of double */
float compute_mean(float *data, int count) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        sum += data[i];
    }
    return sum / count;
}

/* Old version - returns float instead of double */
float compute_variance(float *data, int count) {
    float mean = compute_mean(data, count);
    float sum_sq = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        float diff = data[i] - mean;
        sum_sq += diff * diff;
    }
    return sum_sq / count;
}

/* compute_stddev is MISSING in this old version - this is the main incompatibility */
/* The upgraded analyzer expects this function but it doesn't exist */
