I need to create a Go board with 2-5 groups that tests capture scenarios and surrounded positions.

Let me design a board with:
- A white group surrounded by black stones (testing atari/capture scenarios)
- A few other groups with varying liberties
- Mix of black and white groups

Here's the board content:

.BWB.....
