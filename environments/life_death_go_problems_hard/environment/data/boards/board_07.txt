I need to create a Go board file with 3-5 groups and varying tactical complexity. Let me design a board with interesting liberty situations.

This board contains:
- Group 1: Black stones at B2-C2-B3 (3 stones connected in an L-shape)
- Group 2: White stones at E5-D6-E6-F6-E7 (5 stones in a cross/plus pattern)
- Group 3: Black stone at B9 (single stone)
- Group 4: White stone at H9 (single stone)

Total: 4 groups with varying liberty counts and tactical complexity.
