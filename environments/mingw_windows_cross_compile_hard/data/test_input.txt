The importance of file statistics cannot be overstated in modern computing.
When working with large datasets, understanding the basic metrics of your files
becomes essential for effective data management and processing.

File statistics typically include several key measurements. The most common are
line counts, word counts, and character counts. These simple metrics provide
valuable insights into the structure and size of text documents.

Programmers often use file statistics utilities to analyze source code.
By counting lines of code, they can estimate project complexity and size.
This information helps in project planning and resource allocation.

Writers and editors also benefit from these tools. Word count features help
ensure articles meet publication requirements. Character counts are crucial
for social media posts and other length-restricted content.

Beyond basic counts, advanced statistics might include unique word counts,
average word length, or sentence complexity measures. These metrics provide
deeper insights into text characteristics and readability.

File processing utilities have been fundamental tools since the early days
of Unix systems. Simple commands like wc have stood the test of time,
proving that straightforward tools solving specific problems remain valuable.

Modern implementations often add features like encoding detection, format
analysis, and performance optimizations for handling very large files.
