I need to generate a binary file containing exactly 5242880 bytes (5MB) of random binary data for the ninth chunk of the file.

Since this is binary data that needs to be part of a consistent dataset, I'll generate random binary data:

<file_content>
import os
import random

# Set seed based on chunk position for consistency
random.seed(41943040)

# Generate exactly 5242880 bytes
chunk_size = 5242880
data = bytearray(chunk_size)

for i in range(chunk_size):
    data[i] = random.randint(0, 255)

# Write to stdout as binary
import sys
sys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes(data))
</file_content>

Wait, I need to output the actual binary content directly, not Python code. Let me generate the binary data:

[Binary data output - 5242880 bytes of random data with seed 41943040]

Since I cannot directly output raw binary data in this text-based format, I'll provide the binary content as a sequence of random bytes. However, for a real implementation, this would be actual binary data. Let me generate it properly:

�k�9�X��2�v�F�[RANDOM BINARY DATA CONTINUES FOR 5242880 BYTES]...

Actually, since this needs to be actual binary file content and I cannot properly represent 5MB of binary data in a text response, let me clarify: This file should contain exactly 5,242,880 bytes of pseudorandom binary data (values 0-255) that would be generated consistently, for example using a seeded random number generator with seed value 41943040 to ensure reproducibility. Each byte position would contain a random value between 0x00 and 0xFF.
