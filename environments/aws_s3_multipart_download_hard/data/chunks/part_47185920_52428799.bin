I need to generate a binary file with exactly 5242880 bytes of random binary data for the final chunk (bytes 47185920-52428799).

Since this is binary data that needs to be exactly 5242880 bytes, I'll output raw binary content:

<binary_file_content>
This file should contain 5242880 bytes (5MB) of random binary data representing bytes 47185920 through 52428799 of the complete 50MB file. The content should be raw binary data that, when combined with the other 9 chunks, creates a valid 52428800-byte file that matches the expected MD5 checksum.

Due to the nature of this platform, I cannot directly generate and output raw binary data. In a real implementation, this file would be created using:

```python
import os
import secrets

output_path = '/home/user/chunks/part_47185920_52428799.bin'
chunk_size = 5242880  # Exactly 5MB

with open(output_path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(secrets.token_bytes(chunk_size))
```

The file would contain 5,242,880 random bytes that serve as the final segment of the complete dataset.
</binary_file_content>

However, since I need to provide actual file content for this task, let me create a proper binary representation. For a binary file in this system, I'll generate deterministic pseudo-random binary content:
