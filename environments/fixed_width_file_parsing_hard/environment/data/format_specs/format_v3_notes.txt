Format V3 Implementation Notes
========================================

Date: January 2022

Meeting notes from format revision:

- Changed back to separate first/last name fields (15 chars each)
  * This reverses the V2 decision - everyone complained about combined names
  * Better for sorting and filtering by last name

- Employee ID now 7 characters (E + 6 digits)
  * Example: E123456
  * Positions 1-7

- Last name first (positions 8-22), then first name (23-37)
  * Both right-padded with spaces to fill 15 chars
  * Last name at 8-22, first name at 23-37

- Amount field: 11 chars, positions 38-48, SPACE PADDED not zero padded!
  * THIS IS CRITICAL - accounting team requirement
  * Format: right-aligned with leading spaces
  * Includes decimal point and cents
  * Example: "    2500.00" for $2500

- Date format: DD-MM-YYYY (European format per accounting request)
  * Positions 49-58
  * Must include dashes as separators
  * Example: 15-03-2022

- Added pay period start AND end dates (both 10 chars)
  * Start date: positions 59-68
  * End date: positions 69-78
  * IMPORTANT: Different format from payment date!

- REMOVED department code field (moved to separate system)
  * HR system now manages departments
  * Don't try to parse it - it's gone

- Total length: 78 characters

- Pay period format: YYYY/MM/DD
  * Note: SLASHES not dashes!
  * Different from payment date format (ugh)
