Encryption Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
Key Derivation: SHA-256 hash of shared secret (decimal string), full 32 bytes used as AES key
IV (hex): 7f3a8c2e5d9b4f1a6e8c3d7f2a5b9e4c
Padding: PKCS7

Details:
- The shared secret (decimal integer) is first converted to a string representation
- SHA-256 is computed over the UTF-8 encoded decimal string
- The full 32-byte SHA-256 digest is used directly as the AES-256 key
- AES is used in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode
- The IV (initialization vector) is fixed and provided above
- PKCS7 padding is applied to the plaintext before encryption
- The encrypted message is stored in raw binary format

Decryption steps:
1. Compute the Diffie-Hellman shared secret
2. Convert shared secret to decimal string (e.g., "123456789")
3. Compute SHA-256 hash of the decimal string bytes
4. Use the 32-byte hash as AES-256 key
5. Decrypt using AES-256-CBC with the provided IV
6. Remove PKCS7 padding from decrypted result
