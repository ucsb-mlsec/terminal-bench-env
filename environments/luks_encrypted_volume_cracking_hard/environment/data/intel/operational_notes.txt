OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE - PASSWORD SECURITY ANALYSIS

SUBJECT: Threat Actor Password Construction Patterns

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Analysis of recovered artifacts and historical data indicates the threat actor
demonstrates medium-to-high technical sophistication with consistent operational
security patterns. Password construction methodology shows predictable patterns
that can be leveraged for credential recovery operations.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:

Password Composition Characteristics:
The subject demonstrates consistent password creation habits across multiple
compromised systems. Analysis reveals a preference for passwords ranging from
8 to 16 characters in length, incorporating a blend of alphabetic and numeric
components. All observed passwords contain at least one numeric digit, typically
positioned as a suffix rather than interspersed throughout the password body.

Temporal Patterns:
Intelligence gathering reveals a strong preference for incorporating recent year
values as password suffixes. Observed years include 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and
2024. This temporal anchoring suggests passwords may be periodically updated or
created in alignment with calendar years.

Special Character Usage:
When special characters are employed, the subject consistently favors exclamation
marks (!) and at symbols (@). These characters typically appear at the end of
passwords or immediately following the primary word component. The threat actor
notably avoids complex symbol combinations or excessive special character usage.

Capitalization Conventions:
Standard capitalization patterns observed include first-letter capitalization of
dictionary words or base components. The subject does not typically employ complex
capitalization schemes such as alternating case or mid-word capitals.

Construction Methodology:
Password architecture relies on simple concatenation of components rather than
complex substitution patterns or obfuscation techniques. Base words are joined
with numbers and occasional special characters in straightforward sequential order.

KEY FINDINGS:
• All passwords contain minimum one numeric component (high confidence)
• Year suffixes (2020-2024) appear in majority of observed samples
• First letter capitalization is standard practice
• Special characters limited to ! and @ symbols when present
• Password length consistently falls within 8-16 character range
• Simple concatenation pattern: [Word][Number/Year][Optional Special Char]

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECOVERY OPERATIONS:
1. Prioritize wordlist rules incorporating first-letter capitalization
2. Generate candidates with year suffixes (2020-2024) appended to base words
3. Include variants with trailing ! and @ symbols
4. Focus on 8-16 character length range to optimize processing efficiency
5. Apply simple concatenation rules rather than complex mangling patterns
6. Consider two-word combinations with numeric separators or suffixes

ANALYST NOTES:
The predictable nature of these patterns suggests the subject prioritizes
memorability over cryptographic strength. This operational security weakness
provides significant advantage for credential recovery operations.
