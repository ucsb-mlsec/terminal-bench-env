# Required S3 Operations for Application Access
# Bucket: company-data-bucket
# IAM Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AppRole

This document lists all S3 operations that the application must be able to perform
on the company-data-bucket to function correctly.

## Section 1: data/ prefix operations
Operation: s3:GetObject
Purpose: Read customer and reference data files stored in the data/ prefix
Example: Reading data/customer-info.json for application processing
Use Case: Application needs to fetch configuration and reference data on startup

## Section 2: uploads/ prefix operations
Operation: s3:PutObject
Purpose: Write newly uploaded files from users to the uploads/ prefix
Example: Uploading user-submitted file to uploads/new-data.csv
Use Case: Users submit data files through the web interface that need to be stored

## Section 3: reports/ prefix operations
Operation: s3:ListBucket
Purpose: List and discover all report files available in the reports/ prefix
Example: Listing all files under reports/ to display available reports to users
Use Case: Application dashboard shows list of available reports for download
Note: ListBucket is a bucket-level operation that requires a Condition to filter by prefix

## Section 4: temp/ prefix operations
Operation: s3:DeleteObject
Purpose: Clean up temporary cache files and expired data from temp/ prefix
Example: Deleting temp/cache-12345.tmp after processing completes
Use Case: Background job removes temporary files older than 24 hours

## Additional Notes:
- All operations should be restricted to the specific prefixes to follow least privilege
- The IAM role AppRole must be granted these permissions via bucket policy
- ListBucket requires special handling as it operates on the bucket, not objects
- Current issues: Some operations are being denied due to policy misconfigurations
