Triangle Strip Connectivity Rules for Grid Sections
============================================================

OVERVIEW:
This document describes the mathematical requirements for converting a rectangular vertex grid into a triangle strip primitive for efficient GPU rendering.

PRIMITIVE TYPE:
- Triangle strips are used (NOT triangle lists)
- Each strip is a sequence of connected triangles sharing edges
- Every group of 3 consecutive indices forms a triangle
- After the first triangle, each additional index adds one new triangle

GRID STRUCTURE:
- For an M×N grid, vertices are arranged in rows and columns
- Each vertex has a logical position (row, column)
- Vertices are numbered sequentially: vertex_index = row * width + column
- For our 16×16 grids: indices range from 0 to 255 within each section

TRIANGLE STRIP FORMATION ALGORITHM:
The strip uses a zigzag pattern across rows to create a continuous strip without breaks:

1. Start at top-left corner (row 0, column 0)
2. Traverse row by row, alternating direction each row
3. For each row transition, include vertices from both current and next row
4. Alternate the direction to maintain strip continuity and avoid degenerate triangles

DETAILED PATTERN FOR 16×16 GRID:
- Row 0→1 transition: Move left-to-right
  * Emit vertex pairs: (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,2), (1,2), ..., (0,15), (1,15)
  
- Row 1→2 transition: Move right-to-left  
  * Emit vertex pairs: (1,15), (2,15), (1,14), (2,14), (1,13), (2,13), ..., (1,0), (2,0)
  
- Row 2→3 transition: Move left-to-right
  * Continue pattern...

- Continue alternating for all 15 row transitions (rows 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, ..., 14-15)

WINDING ORDER:
- Must maintain counter-clockwise (CCW) winding order
- The zigzag pattern naturally maintains consistent winding when implemented correctly
- First triangle: vertices at positions (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) wind CCW
- Subsequent triangles alternate winding due to strip rules, but GPU interprets correctly

INDEX COUNT CALCULATION:
For a grid with width W and height H:
- Number of row transitions: H - 1
- Vertices per row transition: 2 * W (one vertex from each of two adjacent rows, for each column)
- Total indices: (H - 1) * 2 * W

For 16×16 grid specifically:
- Width W = 16
- Height H = 16  
- Row transitions = 16 - 1 = 15
- Indices per strip = 15 * 2 * 16 = 15 * 32 = 480 indices

Note: Some implementations may include 2 additional indices for strip initialization = 482 total
However, the standard optimal formula gives: 2 * W * (H - 1) = 2 * 16 * 15 = 480 indices

ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION:
Another way to view this: each row of 16 vertices needs 16 indices from current row and 16 from next row = 32 indices per row pair. With 15 row pairs: 15 × 32 = 480 indices.

PRIMITIVE RESTART INDICES:
- When rendering multiple disconnected grids in one draw call, primitive restart indices separate strips
- A primitive restart index is a special marker value that terminates the current strip
- The next index after a restart begins a new independent strip
- The restart index value must not conflict with any actual vertex index in the buffer

CONCLUSION:
For each 16×16 grid section, the triangle strip requires exactly 480 indices to represent all triangles in the grid with optimal strip formation.
