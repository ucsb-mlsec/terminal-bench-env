DATA WAREHOUSE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS
=========================================

HOT TIER REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
The hot tier is designed for frequently accessed data requiring high performance and low latency.
This tier serves real-time analytics, active queries, and operational dashboards that demand
immediate response times. Data in this tier experiences high I/O operations and concurrent access
patterns. Storage overhead is acceptable in this tier to ensure optimal performance, high
availability, and strong redundancy. The hot tier typically accounts for 10-15% of total data
volume but handles 70-80% of query traffic.

WARM TIER REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
The warm tier provides balanced performance and storage efficiency for moderately accessed data.
This tier hosts recent historical data, periodic reports, and datasets accessed on a regular but
not continuous basis. Access patterns are predictable but less intensive than the hot tier.
The warm tier requires reasonable query performance while optimizing storage costs. It serves
as a middle ground between high-performance hot storage and cost-efficient cold storage.
Typical data age in this tier ranges from 30 days to 1 year, supporting month-end reporting,
quarterly analysis, and trend identification workflows.

COLD TIER REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
The cold tier is optimized for long-term archival storage with minimal storage overhead.
Data in this tier is rarely accessed and primarily retained for compliance, regulatory
requirements, and historical record keeping. Storage efficiency is the primary concern,
with the goal of minimizing storage costs through maximum space optimization. Performance
is not a critical factor as access is infrequent and latency-tolerant. Use cases include
compliance archives, audit logs, long-term backups, and historical datasets beyond active
retention periods. The cold tier should achieve the lowest possible storage overhead ratio
to accommodate large data volumes cost-effectively.
