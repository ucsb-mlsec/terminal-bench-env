I need to generate the content for the tar.gz archive. Let me create the files and archive them.

First, I'll create the individual files with their content, then create the tar.gz archive.

Creating uploads/upload1.txt:
This is a sample upload file from January.
It contains some user-generated content.
Last modified before the backup date.

Creating uploads/document.txt:
Project documentation and notes.
Please review before the next meeting.

Creating uploads/notes.txt:
Meeting notes from Q1 planning session.
Action items: Update database schema, test backup system.
Follow up with team next week.

Creating uploads/file.txt:
General purpose file for testing.
Contains miscellaneous data entries.

Now I'll create the tar.gz archive structure:

mkdir -p /tmp/backup_20240111_170000
mkdir -p /tmp/backup_20240111_170000/uploads

cat > /tmp/backup_20240111_170000/uploads/upload1.txt << 'EOF'
