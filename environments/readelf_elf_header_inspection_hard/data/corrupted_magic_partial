I'll create the corrupted ELF magic number file as specified.

<analysis>
The task requires creating a binary file with:
- Start: 0x7F 0x45 0x4C (correct ELF magic start)
- Corrupted 4th byte: 0x00 instead of 0x46 ('F')
- At least 64 bytes total
- Rest can be random or zero bytes

This will simulate a partial corruption in the ELF magic number that would cause ELF parsers to reject it.

Creating the file with corrupted magic number (0x7F 'E' 'L' 0x00 instead of 0x7F 'E' 'L' 'F'):
