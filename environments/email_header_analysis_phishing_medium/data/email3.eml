Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding our upcoming quarterly review meeting scheduled for next week.

Would Tuesday, November 21st at 2:00 PM EST work for your team? We'd like to discuss the progress on the joint project and review the deliverables for Q4.

The meeting agenda would include:
- Project status update
- Budget review for Q4
- Timeline adjustments
- Resource allocation for next phase

Please let me know if this time works for everyone, or if we need to find an alternative slot. I'm also available Wednesday afternoon if that's more convenient.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
