Platform-Specific Alignment Constraints for Shader Binding Table Records
================================================================================

These alignment requirements are specific to NVIDIA RTX GPU architecture and must be
strictly followed to ensure correct memory access patterns during ray tracing operations.

Record Alignment: 16 bytes
---------------------------
Each SBT record structure must begin at a memory address that is a multiple of 16 bytes.
This ensures proper memory access alignment for the GPU's shader execution units.

Stride Alignment: 64 bytes
---------------------------
The stride value (spacing between consecutive records in the same SBT section) must be
a multiple of 64 bytes. This stricter alignment requirement is necessary for optimal
memory access patterns and coalescing on NVIDIA RTX hardware.

Important Notes:
----------------
- The stride for each SBT section (raygen, miss, hitgroup) must be >= the size of the
  largest record structure in that section.

- The stride must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 64 bytes (stride alignment).

- If the largest record size is not already a multiple of 64 bytes, padding bytes must
  be added to reach the next 64-byte boundary.

- All records within a section use the same stride value, regardless of their individual
  sizes. Smaller records will have unused padding bytes at the end.

- Incorrect stride values will cause the GPU runtime to read from wrong memory offsets,
  resulting in access violations, rendering artifacts, or application crashes.

Example Calculation:
-------------------
If the largest record in a section is 100 bytes:
- 100 bytes / 64 bytes = 1.5625
- Round up to next multiple: 2 × 64 = 128 bytes
- Therefore, stride = 128 bytes
