albedo: should preserve all channels with no modifications (identity mapping)
normal_map: should swap red and blue channels while preserving green and alpha
height_map: should replicate red channel to all RGB channels and preserve alpha from source
roughness: should replicate red channel to RGB channels and set alpha to constant one
metallic: should replicate green channel to all RGB outputs and set alpha to constant one
ambient_occlusion: should replicate red channel across all four RGBA channels
emissive: should preserve RGB channels as-is and set alpha to constant one
opacity_mask: should map red channel to alpha output and zero all RGB channels
displacement: should replicate red channel to RGB and preserve source alpha
specular: should isolate blue channel to RGB outputs and use source alpha channel
lightmap: should preserve all channels in original order (identity mapping)
detail_normal: should reverse the order of RGB channels and preserve alpha
cavity_map: should replicate green channel to all four RGBA channels
transmission: should map red to alpha only with all RGB channels set to zero
blend_mask: should replicate red channel to RGB and set alpha to constant one
