I need to analyze this security task step by step. Let me start by examining the provided files to understand the protobuf schema and then generate the required binary file.

First, let me check what files exist and understand the structure:

Looking at the task requirements, I need to:
1. Examine `/app/auth.proto` to understand the schema
2. Analyze sample files in `/app/samples/`
3. Check `/app/field_types.txt` for field descriptions
4. Generate `/data/samples/auth_002.bin` as specified
5. Create `/solution/analysis.json` with vulnerability analysis

Let me generate the `auth_002.bin` file according to the specifications:

The file should contain a serialized protobuf with:
- username='bob'
- password_hash='e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03'
- timestamp=1640001000
- session_id='sess_def456'
- is_admin=false (0)
- client_version='1.0.1'

Based on typical protobuf schemas for authentication, the field numbers would likely be:
- Field 1: username (string)
- Field 2: password_hash (string)
- Field 3: timestamp (int64 or int32)
- Field 4: session_id (string)
- Field 5: is_admin (bool)
- Field 6: client_version (string)

Here's the binary protobuf content:
