Neuroscience advances reveal neural correlates of awareness while simultaneously deepening the mystery of qualia and phenomenological experience. Debates between materialist and dualist perspectives continue unresolved. Some researchers propose panpsychist frameworks suggesting consciousness as fundamental property of matter, while others maintain emergentist views where consciousness arises from complex information processing. The hard problem of consciousness - explaining why subjective experience exists at all - remains stubbornly resistant to scientific explanation despite remarkable progress in mapping brain function. These questions intersect with ethics, particularly regarding moral status of artificial intelligence and animal welfare. If consciousness exists on a spectrum rather than as binary property, implications for personhood and rights become complex. Additionally, meditation and contemplative practices offer first-person methodologies for investigating consciousness that complement third-person scientific approaches. Integration of Eastern philosophical traditions with Western analytical frameworks may yield insights neither could achieve independently. As we develop more sophisticated brain-computer interfaces and potentially conscious AI systems, these theoretical questions will have profound practical consequences for
