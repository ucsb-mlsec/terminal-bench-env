=== Shadow Volume Rendering Specification ===

Required Parameters:

1. GL_DEPTH_CLAMP must be DISABLED (set to false)
   Reason: Shadow volumes must extend beyond the viewing frustum without being clipped.
   When depth clamping is enabled, it causes artifacts when camera moves close to objects
   or when shadow geometry extends far from camera.

2. DEPTH_CLAMP_NEAR parameter is REQUIRED
   Purpose: Specifies near plane handling for shadow volume depth calculations
   Valid values: 0.0 to 1.0
   Recommended: 0.0

3. DEPTH_CLAMP_FAR parameter is REQUIRED
   Purpose: Specifies far plane handling for shadow volume depth calculations
   Valid values: 0.0 to 1.0
   Recommended: 1.0

4. GL_STENCIL_TEST must be enabled (true)
   Required for shadow volume counting algorithm

5. TWO_SIDED_STENCIL should be enabled (true)
   Allows proper handling of front and back faces of shadow volumes

Depth Buffer Settings:
- DEPTH_TEST should be enabled during shadow rendering
- DEPTH_WRITEMASK should be disabled (false) during shadow volume pass
  to prevent writing to depth buffer while building stencil mask

Conflicting Settings:
- If DEPTH_WRITEMASK is true AND comments indicate it should be disabled
- If POLYGON_OFFSET is enabled while shadow volumes are being used
  (polygon offset conflicts with shadow volume depth calculations)

Common Issues:
- Shadows disappearing near camera: Usually caused by GL_DEPTH_CLAMP being enabled
- Shadow artifacts at distance: Missing DEPTH_CLAMP_FAR parameter
- Incorrect shadow boundaries: Conflicting depth write settings
