I need to analyze the git repository to find orphaned commits and determine the recovery target. Let me start by examining the repository structure.

First, let me look at what's in the repository:

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[user]
	name = Developer
	email = dev@example.com
