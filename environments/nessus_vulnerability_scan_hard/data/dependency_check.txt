[CRITICAL] CVE-2021-44228
Package: log4j-core 2.14.1
Description: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.
---

[CRITICAL] CVE-2021-45046
Package: log4j-core 2.14.1
Description: It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup or a Thread Context Map pattern to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in remote code execution.
---

[CRITICAL] CVE-2022-23305
Package: log4j 1.2.17
Description: By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL execution by the application.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2022-22965
Package: spring-beans 5.3.16
Description: A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, it is not vulnerable to the exploit.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2022-22963
Package: spring-cloud-function-context 3.1.6
Description: In Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older unsupported versions, when using routing functionality it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2020-36518
Package: jackson-databind 2.12.3
Description: Jackson Databind before 2.13.0 allows a Java StackOverflow exception and denial of service via a large depth of nested objects.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2022-42003
Package: jackson-databind 2.12.3
Description: In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.14.0-rc1, resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2021-42550
Package: logback-core 1.2.7
Description: In Logback version 1.2.7 and prior versions, an attacker with the required privileges to edit configurations files could craft a malicious configuration allowing to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2022-42889
Package: commons-text 1.9
Description: Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2021-29425
Package: commons-io 2.8.0
Description: In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, when invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like "//../foo", or "\\..\foo", the result would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory, but not further above (thus "limited" path traversal), if the calling code would use the result to construct a path value.
---

[HIGH] CVE-2022-23221
Package: h2database 1.4.200
Description: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.
---

Package: commons-net 3.6
Description: Prior to Apache Commons Net 3.9.0, Net's FTP client trusts the host from PASV response by default. A malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code to use a different host, but the user has to connect to the malicious server in the first place.
---

Package: httpclient 4.5.12
Description: Apache HttpClient versions prior to version 4.5.13 and 5.0.3 can misinterpret malformed authority component in request URIs passed to the library as java.net.URI object and pick the wrong target host for request execution.
---
