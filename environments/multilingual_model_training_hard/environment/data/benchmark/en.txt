Hello! I'm having some trouble with my recent order #45892 and I'm really hoping you can help me out 😊

I received the wireless headphones yesterday, but they won't connect to my iPhone properly. I've tried restarting both devices multiple times,  but it keeps disconnecting after just a few minutes. Is this a known issue with this model?

Also, I noticed the charging cable that came in the box seems a bit loose when plugged in. It doesn't feel secure at all! I'm worried it might damage the port over time.

I really love the sound quality when they do work, but these connection problems are super frustrating. Can you please help me troubleshoot this, or should I request a replacement? I've been a loyal customer for over 3 years and I'd really appreciate your assistance! 👍

Thanks so much for your time.
