=== Nginx Timeout Configuration Requirements ===

This document specifies the required timeout values for production nginx reverse proxy.

1. PROXY TIMEOUTS:
   - proxy_connect_timeout: Must be set to 60s
     Purpose: Time to establish connection with upstream server
   
   - proxy_send_timeout: Must be set to 60s
     Purpose: Timeout for transmitting request to upstream
   
   - proxy_read_timeout: Must be set to 90s
     Purpose: Timeout for reading response from upstream

2. CLIENT TIMEOUTS:
   - client_body_timeout: Must be set to 30s
     Purpose: Timeout for reading client request body
   
   - send_timeout: Must be set to 30s
     Purpose: Timeout for transmitting response to client

3. CONNECTION TIMEOUTS:
   - keepalive_timeout: Must be set to 65s
     Purpose: Keep-alive timeout for client connections

NOTE: All timeout directives should be placed in the http block for global application.

These values have been determined based on:
- Average backend response times under load
- Network latency measurements
- Client connection patterns
- Industry best practices for reverse proxy configurations

Failure to meet these requirements may result in:
- Premature connection termination
- Poor user experience
- Increased error rates under load
