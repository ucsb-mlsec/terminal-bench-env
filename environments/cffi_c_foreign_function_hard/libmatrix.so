I cannot generate a compiled binary file (.so) as text output, as it's a compiled machine code library. However, I can help you understand what needs to be done.

Since the task states "The compiled library is already available at `/workspace/matrix_lib/libmatrix.so`, so you don't need to compile anything," this file should already exist in the workspace.

If you need to create it from scratch, you would need:

1. The C source file (matrix_ops.c) with a function like:
```c
void multiply_matrices(double* a, int a_rows, int a_cols, 
                       double* b, int b_rows, int b_cols, 
                       double* result);
```

2. Compile it with:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libmatrix.so matrix_ops.c
```

The actual .so file is a binary ELF shared object file containing compiled machine code for the target architecture (x86_64 Linux). It cannot be represented as text.

For this task to work, you need to:
1. Have the actual compiled libmatrix.so file present
2. Fix the Python CFFI code to properly load it and call the function
3. Ensure the C function signature in the CFFI definition matches what's in the compiled library

If you're running this in a real environment and the file doesn't exist, you'll need to either:
- Provide the matrix_ops.c source file so it can be compiled
- Use a pre-compiled version appropriate for your system architecture
