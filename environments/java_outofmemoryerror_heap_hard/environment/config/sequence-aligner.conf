# Sequence Aligner Service Configuration
# This configuration file defines the operational parameters for the sequence-aligner service
# that performs genomic sequence alignment operations using the BWA algorithm

# Service identification and network settings
service.name=sequence-aligner
service.port=8081

# Data directories
# Input directory for unaligned sequence data
data.input.directory=/data/alignment/input
# Output directory for aligned sequence results
data.output.directory=/data/alignment/output

# JVM Memory Configuration
# NOTE: These heap size settings need to be optimized based on memory usage analysis
# Current settings are generic placeholders and may not be appropriate for production workloads
# Analyze memory logs to determine optimal -Xmx (maximum heap) and -Xms (initial heap) values
# Consider GC overhead (typically 20-30% above peak usage) when setting maximum heap size
jvm.options=-Xmx4096m -Xms1024m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200

# Processing configuration
# Number of worker threads for parallel alignment processing
thread.pool.size=8

# Alignment algorithm selection
# BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) is used for short read alignment

# Logging configuration
# Valid levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
logging.level=INFO

# Performance tuning
# Maximum number of sequences to process in a single batch
batch.size=1000
# Timeout for alignment operations (milliseconds)
