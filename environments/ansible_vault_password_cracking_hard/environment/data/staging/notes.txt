Staging Environment Notes
========================

Reminder: Use the same password pattern as production for consistency.
Passwords follow format: common_word + numbers

Files in this directory:
- secrets.vault: Database and Redis credentials
- app_config.vault: Application secrets and OAuth configs

Note: app_config.vault uses a different password scheme.
