I need to analyze the task more carefully. The user is asking me to:

1. First, understand that there's a backup directory structure at `/opt/backup_data` with circular symlinks
2. Create a script to detect these circular symlink chains
3. Output the results to `/tmp/symlink_loops.json`

However, the last part asks me to generate content for a file `opt/backup_data/projects/shared/resources.txt`, which seems to be setting up the test environment.

Let me provide the content for the resources.txt file as requested:

Shared Resources
===============
Common libraries
Shared utilities
Configuration files

Project Dependencies
-------------------
- libcommon.so.1.0
- libutils.so.2.3
- shared-config v1.5

Access Information
-----------------
Location: /opt/backup_data/projects/shared
Permissions: Read-only for project teams
Maintenance: Updated monthly

Resource Inventory
-----------------
1. Common Libraries
   - String manipulation
   - File I/O handlers
   - Network utilities

2. Shared Utilities
   - Backup scripts
   - Log rotation tools
   - Monitoring helpers

3. Configuration Files
   - database.conf
   - network.conf
   - logging.conf

Usage Notes
-----------
All projects should reference these shared resources
rather than maintaining local copies. This ensures
consistency across the backup environment and reduces
storage overhead.
