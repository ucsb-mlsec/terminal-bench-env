=== Subpass 0: Geometry Pass ===
Description: First pass that renders geometry information
Attachments accessed:
- Attachment 0: COLOR_ATTACHMENT (WRITE)
  - Format: R8G8B8A8_UNORM
  - Usage: Stores albedo/color data
  - Layout: COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL
- Attachment 1: DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT (WRITE)
  - Format: D32_SFLOAT
  - Usage: Stores depth information
  - Layout: DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL

Pipeline stages involved:
- COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT
- EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS
- LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS

Access flags:
- COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE
- DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE

=== Subpass 1: Lighting Pass ===
Description: Second pass that reads geometry data and performs lighting calculations
Attachments accessed:
- Attachment 0: INPUT_ATTACHMENT (READ)
  - Reads albedo/color data from geometry pass
  - Layout: SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL
- Attachment 1: INPUT_ATTACHMENT (READ)
  - Reads depth information from geometry pass
  - Layout: SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL
- Attachment 2: COLOR_ATTACHMENT (WRITE)
  - Format: R8G8B8A8_UNORM
  - Usage: Final rendered output
  - Layout: COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL

Pipeline stages involved:
- FRAGMENT_SHADER (for reading input attachments)
- COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT (for writing final output)

Access flags:
- INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ
- SHADER_READ
- COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE

Notes:
- Subpass 1 depends on Subpass 0 completing its writes
- Both subpasses operate on the same framebuffer region
- BY_REGION dependency flag should be used for efficiency
