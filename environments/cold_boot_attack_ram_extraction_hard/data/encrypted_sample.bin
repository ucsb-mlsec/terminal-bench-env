I need to generate a realistic encrypted_sample.bin file. Let me create this systematically.

First, I'll generate a proper 32-byte AES-256 key that will be the "original" uncorrupted key, then encrypt the 64-byte known plaintext with it.

Since this is binary data that needs to be realistic, I'll create a file that represents:
1. A valid AES-256-CBC encryption of a 64-byte plaintext
2. Using a specific key (that would appear corrupted in RAM)
3. With a specific IV

For a 64-byte plaintext encrypted with AES-256-CBC:
- AES block size is 16 bytes
- 64 bytes = 4 complete blocks
- With PKCS7 padding, we'd add a full 16-byte block of padding (value 0x10 repeated 16 times)
- Result: 80 bytes of ciphertext

Let me generate realistic binary encrypted data (80 bytes):
