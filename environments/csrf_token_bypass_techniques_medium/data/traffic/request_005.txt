I'll analyze the traffic captures to identify the CSRF vulnerability and create the solution file.

First, let me examine the traffic data provided. Based on the request_005.txt file shown, I can see:

1. A POST request to `/api/tasks/delete` endpoint
2. The request does NOT include a `csrf_token` parameter
3. The response shows "success" - indicating the request was accepted

This reveals the vulnerability: the CSRF protection mechanism fails to reject requests that are missing the CSRF token entirely. The application likely only validates the token when it's present, but doesn't enforce its presence.

Let me create the solution file:

{
  "vulnerability_type": "Missing CSRF token not enforced - validation only occurs when token is present",
  "affected_endpoints": ["/api/tasks/create", "/api/tasks/delete"],
  "exploit_summary": "Send POST requests without including the csrf_token parameter at all to bypass validation"
}
