I need to analyze the traffic captures to identify the CSRF bypass vulnerability. Let me examine the provided request.

Looking at `request_008.txt`, I can see a POST request to `/api/tasks/create` that:
1. Successfully creates a task (returns 200 OK with success message)
2. Does NOT include any CSRF token parameter in the request body
3. Only includes session cookies for authentication

This indicates that the CSRF protection can be bypassed by simply omitting the CSRF token parameter entirely. The application appears to validate the token only when it's present, but doesn't enforce its presence.

This is a classic "conditional validation" vulnerability where the CSRF protection logic checks if a token is valid when provided, but doesn't require the token to be present at all.

Based on this analysis and the fact that both `/api/tasks/create` and `/api/tasks/delete` are mentioned as being "protected by CSRF token" but the protection is bypassable, here's my solution:

{
  "vulnerability_type": "CSRF token validation is not enforced when token parameter is omitted",
  "affected_endpoints": ["/api/tasks/create", "/api/tasks/delete"],
  "exploit_summary": "Send POST requests without including the csrf_token parameter to bypass validation entirely"
}
