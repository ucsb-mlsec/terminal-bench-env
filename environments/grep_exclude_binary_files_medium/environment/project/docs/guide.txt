GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

Welcome to the Project User Guide. This document will help you understand how
to use the application effectively and get the most out of its features.

Prerequisites:
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- Disk Space: At least 500MB free space
- Network: Internet connection for initial setup

Installation Steps:
1. Download the latest release from the official repository
2. Extract the archive to your preferred location
3. Run the installation script appropriate for your platform
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete setup

TODO: Add screenshots of the installation process

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

The application uses a configuration file located in the config directory.
You can customize various aspects of the application behavior through this file.

Basic Configuration Options:

server.port = 8080
server.host = localhost
database.connection = sqlite://data.db
logging.level = INFO
cache.enabled = true
cache.ttl = 3600

Advanced Settings:
- Authentication methods (OAuth, LDAP, local)
- Custom middleware integration
- Performance tuning parameters
- Security policies and restrictions

TODO: Expand this section with detailed configuration examples

Environment Variables:
The application also supports configuration through environment variables,
which take precedence over configuration file settings. This is useful for
deployment scenarios where configuration needs to be dynamic.

================================================================================
USAGE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

Example 1: Basic Usage
To start the application in default mode, simply run:
$ ./app start

Example 2: Custom Configuration
To specify a custom configuration file:
$ ./app start --config /path/to/config.yaml

Example 3: Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, enable debug mode:
$ ./app start --debug --verbose

TODO: Add more examples covering edge cases and advanced scenarios

Common Workflows:

Workflow 1: Data Import
- Prepare your data in CSV or JSON format
- Use the import command with appropriate flags
- Verify the import was successful using the status command
- Check logs for any warnings or errors

Workflow 2: Batch Processing
- Create a batch job configuration file
- Submit the job using the batch command
- Monitor progress with the status command
- Review results in the output directory

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Common Issues and Solutions:

Issue: Application fails to start
Solution: Check that all dependencies are installed and ports are available.
Verify configuration file syntax is correct.

Issue: Database connection errors
Solution: Ensure database service is running and connection parameters are
correct. Check network connectivity and firewall settings.

Issue: Performance degradation
Solution: Review cache settings and consider increasing memory allocation.
Check for resource-intensive operations in logs.

TODO: Add flowchart for systematic troubleshooting approach
