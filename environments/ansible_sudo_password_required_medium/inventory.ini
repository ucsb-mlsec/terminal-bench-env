# Task 1: Creating the Ansible command with sudo password handling

The correct ansible-playbook command needs the `--ask-become-pass` (or `-K`) flag to prompt for the sudo password. This flag tells Ansible to prompt for the privilege escalation password before executing the playbook.

Writing to /tmp/ansible_command.txt:

ansible-playbook -i /home/ansible-project/inventory.ini /home/ansible-project/site.yml --ask-become-pass


# Task 2: Creating the inventory.ini file

The inventory file should contain a group with multiple hosts in standard INI format:

[webservers]
localhost ansible_connection=local
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
