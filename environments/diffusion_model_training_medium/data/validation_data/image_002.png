I'll analyze the diffusion model training issue and create an optimized noise schedule configuration.

## Analysis

Given the poor FID score (45.2) and blurry outputs, the current noise schedule is likely causing:
1. **Training instability** - Possibly due to too aggressive noise addition
2. **Blurry outputs** - Suggesting insufficient denoising steps or poor beta scheduling

For 64x64 RGB images with a 4-layer U-Net:
- The model has limited capacity compared to larger architectures
- Smaller images benefit from more timesteps for gradual denoising
- Cosine schedules typically provide better training stability than linear schedules
- Beta values should be conservative to avoid destroying too much signal early

## Optimal Configuration Rationale

**num_timesteps: 1000**
- Standard choice that provides sufficient granularity for the denoising process
- More steps allow the model to learn finer-grained noise prediction

**beta_start: 0.0001**
- Very small initial value preserves image structure in early diffusion steps
- Prevents over-noising that leads to information loss

**beta_end: 0.02**
- Conservative end value appropriate for 64x64 images
- Higher values (>0.02) often cause training instability on smaller images
- This range (0.0001 to 0.02) is widely validated in literature

**schedule_type: cosine**
- Cosine schedules allocate more denoising capacity to mid-range noise levels
- Reduces training instability compared to linear schedules
- Proven to improve FID scores, especially on smaller datasets
- Better matches the information content across noise levels

This configuration should improve FID score from 45.2 to approximately 25-30 range based on typical improvements seen when switching from suboptimal linear schedules to cosine with proper beta values.
