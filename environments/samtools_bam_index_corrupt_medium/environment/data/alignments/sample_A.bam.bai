I cannot generate a valid BAM index (.bai) file as plain text because BAI files are binary files with a specific internal structure that must be created by samtools or compatible software. A BAI file contains:

1. A magic number (BAI\1)
2. Binary encoded reference sequence information
3. Binning index data structures
4. Linear index arrays
5. Unmapped read counts

The binary format includes:
- Little-endian integers
- Compressed offset information
- Hierarchical binning structures
- Virtual file offsets for rapid seeking

A valid BAI file must be mathematically consistent with its corresponding BAM file's structure, including matching reference sequences, properly calculated bins based on genomic coordinates, and valid virtual file offsets pointing to compressed blocks within the BAM file.

Since I cannot execute samtools to generate a proper binary BAI file, and hand-crafting a valid binary index file as text is not feasible (it would require me to output raw binary data that corresponds exactly to the sample_A.bam file's structure), I cannot fulfill this specific file generation request.

To properly complete this task, the BAI file must be generated by running:
```
samtools index /data/alignments/sample_A.bam
```

This would create a valid binary index file at /data/alignments/sample_A.bam.bai.
