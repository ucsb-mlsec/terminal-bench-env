# GPU Configuration File
# This file contains GPU device settings and operational parameters

# Compute Mode Configuration
# Options: Default, EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS, EXCLUSIVE_THREAD, PROHIBITED
# Default: Allows multiple processes to use the GPU simultaneously
# EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS: Only one process can use the GPU at a time
ComputeMode=Default

# Persistence Mode
# When enabled, the NVIDIA driver remains loaded even when no applications are running
# This reduces application startup time and maintains consistent GPU state
PersistenceMode=Enabled

# Power Management Settings
# PowerLimit: Maximum power consumption in watts (0 = no limit)
# Note: Actual limit depends on GPU model capabilities
PowerLimit=300

# Application Clock Settings
# When enabled, locks GPU clocks to application-specified values
# Disabled allows dynamic clock adjustment based on workload
ApplicationClocks=Disabled

# Memory Allocation Configuration
# Defines how GPU memory is allocated and managed
# Dynamic: Memory allocated as needed by applications
MemoryAllocation=Dynamic

# ECC Memory Mode
# Error Correcting Code memory for improved reliability
# Requires GPU hardware support
ECCMode=Disabled

# GPU Operating Mode
# Standard: Normal multi-process GPU operation
# MPS: Multi-Process Service for concurrent kernel execution (NOT ENABLED)
GPUMode=Standard
