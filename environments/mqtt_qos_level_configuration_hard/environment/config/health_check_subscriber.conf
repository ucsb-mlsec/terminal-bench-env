# MQTT Health Check Subscriber Configuration
# This subscriber monitors diagnostic heartbeat messages from IoT sensors
# System health checks can tolerate some message loss for minimal overhead

# Topic for receiving diagnostic heartbeat messages
topic=sensors/heartbeat

[subscriber]
# Client identifier for this health monitoring service
client_id=health_monitor
# QoS level for heartbeat messages
# NOTE: Heartbeat messages are diagnostic only and can tolerate loss
# Using QoS 0 (at most once) for minimal network overhead and best performance
qos=0
# Do not retain heartbeat messages as they are time-sensitive
retain=false

[connection]
# Clean session enabled - no need to persist heartbeat message state
# Heartbeat messages are frequent and missing a few is acceptable
