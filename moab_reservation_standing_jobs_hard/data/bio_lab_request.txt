STANDING RESERVATION REQUEST FORM

Request Reference Number: CBL-2024-SR-047
Submission Date: March 15, 2024

================================================================================

SECTION 1: CONTACT INFORMATION

Lab Name: Computational Biology Lab
Department: Molecular and Cellular Biology
Principal Investigator: Dr. Sarah Chen
Primary Contact: Dr. James Morrison
Email: j.morrison@university.edu
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Building/Office: Science Research Building, Room 308

================================================================================

SECTION 2: RESERVATION PURPOSE

Project Title: High-Throughput Genomics Pipeline for Comparative Analysis

Purpose Statement:
The Computational Biology Lab requests a standing reservation to support our
weekly genomics pipeline processing. This pipeline performs variant calling,
sequence alignment, and comparative genomic analysis on large-scale datasets
generated from our ongoing research into gene expression patterns. The weekly
batch processing is critical for maintaining our research timeline and ensuring
reproducible computational results.

Funding Source: NSF Grant #BIO-2024-8891
Project Duration: 24 months (through March 2026)

================================================================================

SECTION 3: RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

Partition Requested: standard
Number of Compute Nodes: 12
Cores per Node: Default partition configuration
Memory Requirements: Standard allocation per node
Storage: Access to /project/biolab shared filesystem
Special Requirements: None - standard compute nodes sufficient

================================================================================

SECTION 4: TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION

Frequency: Weekly recurring
Day of Week: Tuesday
Start Time: 09:00
End Time: 18:00
Time Zone: Local cluster time
Duration: 9 hours per week

Justification for Time Window:
Tuesday scheduling allows our team to prepare datasets on Monday and review
results on Wednesday. The 9-hour window accommodates our complete pipeline
execution including quality control steps. This consistent weekly schedule
enables reproducible research practices and efficient resource planning.

================================================================================

SECTION 5: ACCESS CONTROL

Primary User Group: biolab
Group Members: Managed through /etc/group on cluster systems
Estimated Active Users: 8-12 researchers
Authorized to Submit Jobs: All members of biolab group

Additional Access Notes:
Only members of the biolab group should be permitted to submit jobs to this
reservation. No guest or external collaborator access required at this time.

================================================================================

SECTION 6: PRIORITY AND SCHEDULING

Requested Priority Level: Normal priority
Acceptable to Share Resources: No - exclusive access required
Backfill Acceptable: Yes, if reservation time slots are unused
Preemption Policy: Standard cluster policies apply

================================================================================

SECTION 7: JUSTIFICATION

Scientific Impact:
This reservation supports NIH and NSF-funded research in genomics that has
resulted in 12 peer-reviewed publications over the past 3 years. Consistent
access to computational resources is essential for maintaining research
momentum and meeting grant deliverables.

Reproducibility Requirements:
Our research protocols require consistent computational environments and
resource availability to ensure reproducible results. Standing reservations
eliminate variability in job scheduling and resource allocation that can
affect pipeline execution times and scientific reproducibility.

Resource Utilization:
Historical data shows our Tuesday pipeline jobs utilize 12 nodes at >85%
efficiency for the full 9-hour window. This standing reservation will improve
cluster utilization by eliminating queue waiting time and job fragmentation.

================================================================================

SECTION 8: ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Our group commits to utilizing the reserved resources efficiently and
  reporting utilization metrics quarterly to the HPC administration team
  
- We will notify the scheduler administrator at least 2 weeks in advance if
  the reservation will not be used due to holidays or planned maintenance

- We request configuration of appropriate access controls to prevent
  unauthorized use of our allocated reservation time

- Contact person for technical coordination: James Morrison (j.morrison@university.edu)
