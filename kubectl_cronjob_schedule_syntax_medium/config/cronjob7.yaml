I need to create the `cronjob7.yaml` file with an invalid cron schedule as specified. The file should have month value 13, which is invalid (valid range is 1-12).

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: quarterly-audit
  namespace: compliance
spec:
  schedule: "0 8 1 13 *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: audit-container
            image: audit-tool:v2.3
            command: ["python3", "audit.py"]
          restartPolicy: Never
