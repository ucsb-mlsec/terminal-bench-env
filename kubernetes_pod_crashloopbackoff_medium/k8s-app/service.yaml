I need to first examine the files in the `/workspace/k8s-app/` directory to understand what's causing the CrashLoopBackOff error. Let me start by exploring the workspace.

```bash
ls -la /workspace/k8s-app/
```

Since I need to generate the service.yaml file first as requested, then analyze all files:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: python-api-service
  labels:
    app: python-api
    tier: backend
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: python-api
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
