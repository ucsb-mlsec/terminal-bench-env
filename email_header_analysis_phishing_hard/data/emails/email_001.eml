Dear Team Member,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to schedule our quarterly review meeting for Q1 2024.

We need to discuss:
- Performance metrics for the past quarter
- Goals and objectives for Q2
- Budget allocations
- Team expansion plans

Could you please review your calendar and let me know your availability for the week of January 22-26? I'm flexible with timing and can accommodate your schedule.

The meeting should take approximately 90 minutes. We can meet either in Conference Room B or via video conference, whichever works best for you.

Please confirm your availability by end of day Wednesday.

Best regards,

John Sender
Senior Manager, Operations
Company Inc.
