Site B's private key found in backup - same as Site E??? SECURITY ISSUE
Need to regenerate immediately!

- Site B: vpn-site-b.example.com:51821
- Site C: ??? (missing)
- Site D: ??? (need to check with IT)

AllowedIPs setup:
- Each peer needs /24 subnet + tunnel IP
- Site A should allow: 10.200.1.0/24
- Site B should allow: 10.200.2.0/24
- (incomplete list... need to finish)

PersistentKeepalive = 25 (for NAT traversal)

NOTES:
- Old admin mentioned some configs were mixed up
- Check if endpoint ports are correct
- Verify no IP conflicts between sites
- Make sure routing works both ways
