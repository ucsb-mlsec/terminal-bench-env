--- BASE TABLE METRICS ---
Write Operations:
- Write requests: 50,000 writes/minute (833.33 writes/second)
- Average item size: 2 KB (2048 bytes)
- Write throttle events: 127 events in past 24 hours
- Consumed Write Capacity: Average 850 WCU during peak

Read Operations:
- Read requests: 10,000 reads/minute (166.67 reads/second)
- Eventually consistent reads: 95%
- Strong consistent reads: 5%
- Consumed Read Capacity: Average 175 RCU during peak

--- GSI: event-type-index METRICS ---
Index Write Operations:
- All base table writes replicate to this GSI (100% write propagation)
- Index item size: 2 KB (full projection)
- Consumed Write Capacity: Average 835 WCU during peak
- Write throttle events: 243 events in past 24 hours

Index Read Operations:
- Query pattern 1: 5,000 queries/minute
- Average items returned per query: 10 items
- Eventually consistent reads only
- Consumed Read Capacity: Average 420 RCU during peak
- Read throttle events: 89 events in past 24 hours

--- GSI: region-index METRICS ---
Index Write Operations:
- Sparse index: Only 60% of items have region attribute
- Items written to index: ~30,000 writes/minute (60% of base)
- Index item size: 2 KB (full projection)
- Consumed Write Capacity: Average 505 WCU during peak
- Write throttle events: 178 events in past 24 hours

Index Read Operations:
- Query pattern 2: 2,000 queries/minute
- Average items returned per query: 20 items
- Eventually consistent reads only
- Consumed Read Capacity: Average 267 RCU during peak
- Read throttle events: 34 events in past 24 hours

--- COST ANALYSIS ---
Provisioned Capacity Costs (Monthly):
- Base table: $421.20 (500 RCU + 500 WCU)
- GSI 1 (event-type-index): $252.72 (200 RCU + 200 WCU)
- GSI 2 (region-index): $216.72 (150 RCU + 150 WCU)
- Total Monthly Cost: $890.64

--- PERFORMANCE ISSUES ---
- P99 latency for writes: 245ms (baseline: 25ms)
- P99 latency for GSI queries: 380ms (baseline: 35ms)
- Total throttle events (7 days): 671 throttles
- Estimated impact: 12,500 failed/retried operations per day
