# Throughput-Optimized Profile
# This configuration maximizes application throughput by allowing longer GC pauses
# in exchange for better overall processing efficiency. Ideal for batch processing
# and non-interactive workloads where pause time is less critical.

-Xms6G
# Initial heap size - large allocation reduces resizing overhead

-Xmx6G
# Maximum heap size - matching Xms eliminates dynamic heap resizing

-XX:+UseParallelGC
# Parallel GC collector - optimized for throughput on multi-core systems

-XX:ParallelGCThreads=16
# High thread count for GC operations - maximizes collection throughput

-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy
# Automatic tuning of generation sizes based on throughput goals

-XX:GCTimeRatio=99
# Target 1% of time in GC, 99% in application - prioritizes throughput

-XX:NewRatio=2
# Young generation is 1/3 of heap - larger young gen reduces collection frequency

-XX:SurvivorRatio=8
# Eden is 8x larger than each survivor space - optimizes object promotion

-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled
# Parallel reference processing for better throughput

-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500
# Allows up to 500ms pauses - acceptable for batch workloads

-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=70
# Start concurrent marking at 70% occupancy - balances memory utilization

-XX:+UseCompressedOops
# Compressed pointers for better memory efficiency on 64-bit JVMs

-XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers
# Compress class pointer metadata for reduced overhead

-XX:+DisableExplicitGC
# Ignore System.gc() calls that could disrupt throughput optimization

-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch
# Touch all memory pages at startup - eliminates allocation latency during runtime
