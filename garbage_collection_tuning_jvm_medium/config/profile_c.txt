# Balanced GC Configuration Profile
# This profile provides a middle-ground approach between low latency and high throughput
# Suitable for applications that need reasonable pause times without sacrificing too much throughput

# Use G1 Garbage Collector - good balance for most workloads
-XX:+UseG1GC

# Heap sizing - moderate memory allocation
-Xms4G
-Xmx4G

# Target moderate GC pause times - balance between responsiveness and throughput
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100

# Set initiating heap occupancy threshold for concurrent marking - balanced value
-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45

# Young generation sizing - moderate ratio
-XX:G1NewSizePercent=25
-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40

# Parallel GC threads - utilize multiple cores for collection work
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=8

# Concurrent marking threads - reasonable concurrency
-XX:ConcGCThreads=2

# G1 region size - moderate for balanced allocation
-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M

# Reserve percentage - standard overhead
-XX:G1ReservePercent=10

# Mixed GC parameters - balanced reclamation strategy
-XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=8
-XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5

# Enable GC logging for monitoring
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps

# String deduplication - memory optimization with minimal overhead
-XX:+UseStringDeduplication
