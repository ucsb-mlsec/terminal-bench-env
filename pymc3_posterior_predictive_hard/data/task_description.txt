Climate Research Laboratory - Weather Prediction Task
========================================================

Background:
This dataset contains weather observations collected from our primary meteorological station over a continuous 100-day period during the spring season. The station is equipped with automated sensors that record atmospheric conditions at hourly intervals, which are then aggregated to produce daily averages.

Variable Descriptions:
- humidity: Relative humidity percentage (0-100%), representing the amount of moisture in the air
- pressure: Atmospheric pressure measured in millibars (mb), typically ranging from 980-1040 mb
- wind_speed: Average daily wind speed in kilometers per hour (km/h)
- temperature: Average daily temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)

Project Objectives:
Our research team requires Bayesian statistical methods for this prediction task because we need robust uncertainty quantification to inform our climate model validation procedures. Point estimates alone are insufficient for our decision-making processes, as we must understand the range of plausible temperature values given the observed atmospheric conditions.

Data Context:
The prediction dataset (prediction_data.csv) represents 10 recent days where our temperature sensors experienced calibration issues and produced unreliable readings. However, the humidity, pressure, and wind speed measurements from these days remain valid and can be used to infer the missing temperature values.

Application:
The predictions generated from this analysis will be integrated into our regional climate modeling framework and used to validate the performance of our temperature forecasting algorithms under various atmospheric conditions.
