I'll help you recover the orphaned commits. Let me start by examining the Git repository structure and finding the orphaned commits.

First, let me explore the repository and identify all commits:

```bash
cd /workspace/repo

# Find all commit objects in the object database
find .git/objects -type f | grep -v pack | while read obj; do
    # Extract SHA from path
    dir=$(basename $(dirname $obj))
    file=$(basename $obj)
    if [ ${#dir} -eq 2 ] && [ ${#file} -eq 38 ]; then
        sha="${dir}${file}"
        type=$(git cat-file -t $sha 2>/dev/null)
        if [ "$type" = "commit" ]; then
            echo $sha
        fi
    fi
done > /tmp/all_commits.txt

# Find reachable commits from all refs
git rev-list --all > /tmp/reachable_commits.txt

# Find orphaned commits (in object db but not reachable)
comm -23 <(sort /tmp/all_commits.txt) <(sort /tmp/reachable_commits.txt) > /tmp/orphaned_commits.txt

# Get commit timestamps and find the most recent orphaned commit
latest_commit=""
latest_timestamp=0

while read commit; do
    timestamp=$(git cat-file -p $commit | grep "^committer" | sed 's/.* \([0-9]\{10\}\) .*/\1/')
    if [ $timestamp -gt $latest_timestamp ]; then
        latest_timestamp=$timestamp
        latest_commit=$commit
    fi
done < /tmp/orphaned_commits.txt

# Count orphaned commits
orphaned_count=$(wc -l < /tmp/orphaned_commits.txt)

# Write results
echo "ORPHANED_COUNT=$orphaned_count" > /workspace/result.txt
echo "LATEST_COMMIT=$latest_commit" >> /workspace/result.txt
