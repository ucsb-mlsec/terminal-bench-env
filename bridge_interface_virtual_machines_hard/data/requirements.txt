VM GROUPS DEFINITION
====================

1. production
   - IP Range: 10.100.1.0/24
   - Purpose: Production web services and application servers
   - Hosts customer-facing applications

2. development
   - IP Range: 10.100.2.0/24
   - Purpose: Development and staging environment
   - Used by developers for testing new features

3. testing
   - IP Range: 10.100.3.0/24
   - Purpose: Quality assurance and automated testing
   - Isolated testing environment for CI/CD pipelines

4. database
   - IP Range: 10.100.4.0/24
   - Purpose: Database servers and data storage
   - Contains sensitive data requiring isolation

5. monitoring
   - IP Range: 10.100.5.0/24
   - Purpose: Infrastructure monitoring and logging services
   - Collects metrics and logs from all environments


EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS
===================================

Physical Interface: eth0

Groups requiring external network access:
- production: requires external access for public services and API endpoints
- development: requires external access for package downloads and repository access
- monitoring: requires external access for alerting and external monitoring endpoints

Note: External connectivity must be configured through proper bridge forwarding


ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS
======================

The following VM groups must be isolated with NO external network forwarding:

- database: must be isolated, no direct external access allowed
  * Contains sensitive customer data
  * Should only be accessible from internal networks
  
- testing: isolated environment, no external connectivity
  * Prevents test traffic from reaching production systems
  * Maintains clean testing environment


ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

IP Forwarding:
- Enable IP forwarding only for bridges that require external connectivity
- Isolated networks must have forwarding disabled

Bridge Naming:
- Bridge names must follow Linux interface naming conventions
- Maximum 15 characters per bridge name
- Use descriptive names based on VM group purpose

Bridge Configuration:
- Each VM group requires its own dedicated bridge interface
- Bridges must not share network segments
- Proper isolation between bridges must be maintained
