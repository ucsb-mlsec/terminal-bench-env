Development Environment Info
============================

Dev vaults may share passwords with production for convenience.
Some test vaults use predictable passwords for easy access.

Vault files:
- credentials.vault: Development database and test credentials
- test_vault.vault: Test environment configuration

Common passwords in use:
- dev123
- testing
- password123
- ansible

Note: The staging vault uses the same password as production for deployment consistency.
