SENSOR DATA BINARY FORMAT SPECIFICATION
==============================================

VERSION: 1.0
DATE: 2024-01-15

RECORD FORMAT SPECIFICATION
----------------------------

Total record size: 24 bytes (MUST be exact - no padding allowed)

FIELD LAYOUT (byte offsets from start of record):

Offset 0-3 (4 bytes): sensor_id (uint32_t)
  - Unsigned 32-bit integer
  - Unique identifier for the sensor
  - Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295

Offset 4-11 (8 bytes): timestamp (uint64_t)
  - Unsigned 64-bit integer
  - Unix timestamp in milliseconds
  - Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

Offset 12-15 (4 bytes): temperature (float)
  - IEEE 754 single-precision floating point
  - Temperature reading in degrees Celsius
  - Typical range: -50.0 to 150.0

Offset 16-19 (4 bytes): humidity (float)
  - IEEE 754 single-precision floating point
  - Relative humidity percentage
  - Range: 0.0 to 100.0

Offset 20-23 (4 bytes): pressure (float)
  - IEEE 754 single-precision floating point
  - Atmospheric pressure in kPa
  - Typical range: 80.0 to 120.0


CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

1. NO PADDING BYTES: The structure must be tightly packed with no padding
   between fields or at the end of the structure.

2. EXACT SIZE: Each record must be exactly 24 bytes. The compiler must not
   add any alignment padding.

3. BYTE ORDER: All multi-byte values use the native byte order of the system.

4. ALIGNMENT: The structure must use compiler directives to prevent automatic
   alignment/padding. For GCC/Clang, use: __attribute__((packed))
   For MSVC, use: #pragma pack(1)

5. PORTABILITY: The format must work consistently on both 32-bit and 64-bit
   systems.


EXAMPLE BINARY LAYOUT
----------------------

Visual representation of a single record (24 bytes total):

[sensor_id][  timestamp  ][temperature][humidity][pressure]
[4 bytes  ][   8 bytes   ][ 4 bytes  ][4 bytes ][4 bytes]
     ↓           ↓              ↓          ↓         ↓
  Offset 0    Offset 4    Offset 12  Offset 16  Offset 20


SAMPLE RECORD (hexadecimal byte representation):

sensor_id = 1001 (0x000003E9)
timestamp = 1705334400000 (0x0000018D2E8E7C00)
temperature = 23.5°C (0x41BC0000)
humidity = 65.0% (0x42820000)
pressure = 101.3 kPa (0x42CA6666)

Byte sequence (24 bytes):
E9 03 00 00 00 7C 8E 2E 8D 01 00 00 00 00 BC 41 00 00 82 42 66 66 CA 42


FILE FORMAT
-----------

The binary output file consists of:
- Multiple consecutive records
- Each record is exactly 24 bytes
- No header, footer, or separator bytes
- File size = (number of records) × 24 bytes


VALIDATION
----------

To verify correct binary format:
1. Check file size is a multiple of 24
2. Verify each field appears at the documented offset
3. Confirm no padding bytes exist between fields
4. Test reading the binary data with the documented structure
