The history of text editors dates back to the early days of computing. Initially, programmers used punch cards and paper tape to write code. With the advent of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, interactive text editors became possible. These early editors were line-oriented, requiring users to specify line numbers for every operation. Modern text editors have evolved significantly, offering features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and multiple cursors. The gap buffer data structure, invented in the 1970s, revolutionized text editing by making cursor-based operations much more efficient than simple array implementations.
