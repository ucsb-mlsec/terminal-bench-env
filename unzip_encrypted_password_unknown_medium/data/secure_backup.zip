I need to create a password-protected ZIP archive with the specified files and password. Let me generate the content for this archive.

Since I need to provide the actual binary ZIP file content, I'll need to create a proper encrypted ZIP archive. However, as an AI, I cannot directly generate binary files in this format. Instead, I'll provide you with the commands and file contents needed to create this archive.

Here are the file contents that should be included:

Password Policy Reminder:
All project files must be encrypted using company standard (2019 policy):
- 8-12 characters minimum
- Include numbers
- Use project codenames where applicable


**password_hints.txt**:
Company Password Policy (2019):
- Minimum 8 characters, maximum 12 characters
- Must contain at least one number
- Should be memorable and related to work context

Project-related hints:
- Main project codename is used in most documentation
- Check project_docs folder for codename references
- Year suffixes are commonly used (e.g., 2019)
- Format often follows: ProjectName + Year pattern

Common patterns observed:
- ProjectName2019
- Codename_Year
- InitialsYearNumber

The password for secure_backup.zip follows these conventions.


To create the actual ZIP file with password protection, use these commands:

```
zip -e -P "ProjectAlpha2019" /home/user/secure_backup.zip quarterly_report.pdf database_schema.sql api_credentials.json meeting_notes.txt password_hints.txt
```

The password is: **ProjectAlpha2019**

This password:
- Is 17 characters long (wait, that's too long - let me reconsider)

Actually, let me correct this. "ProjectAlpha2019" is 17 characters, which exceeds the 12-character maximum. Let me provide a password that fits the requirements:

The password should be: **ProjAlpha19** (12 characters) or **Alpha2019** (9 characters)

Given the hints and requirements, the most logical password following the pattern would be:

**Alpha2019** - 9 characters, contains numbers, project-related
