I'll generate the binary model weights file with the specified requirements.

```python
import struct
import numpy as np

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Generate 10,000 weights with the specified distribution
num_weights = 10000

# We want ~60-70% to be pruned (absolute value < 0.15)
# and ~30-40% to remain (absolute value >= 0.15)

# Generate weights in different categories
num_small = 6500  # Will be pruned (65%)
num_medium = 2500  # Will remain (25%)
num_large = 1000   # Will remain (10%)

weights = []

# Small weights (will be pruned): -0.15 < weight < 0.15
small_weights = np.random.uniform(-0.149, 0.149, num_small)
weights.extend(small_weights)

# Medium weights: 0.15 <= |weight| < 0.6
medium_positive = np.random.uniform(0.15, 0.6, num_medium // 2)
medium_negative = np.random.uniform(-0.6, -0.15, num_medium // 2)
weights.extend(medium_positive)
weights.extend(medium_negative)

# Larger weights: 0.6 <= |weight| <= 1.0
large_positive = np.random.uniform(0.6, 1.0, num_large // 2)
large_negative = np.random.uniform(-1.0, -0.6, num_large // 2)
weights.extend(large_positive)
weights.extend(large_negative)

# Shuffle to mix the weights
weights = np.array(weights)
np.random.shuffle(weights)

# Write to binary file
with open('/workspace/model_weights.dat', 'wb') as f:
    for weight in weights:
        # Pack as little-endian 32-bit float
        f.write(struct.pack('<f', weight))

print(f"Generated {len(weights)} weights")
print(f"File size: {len(weights) * 4} bytes")
print(f"Weights with |w| < 0.15: {np.sum(np.abs(weights) < 0.15)}")
print(f"Weights with |w| >= 0.15: {np.sum(np.abs(weights) >= 0.15)}")
```

Now I'll create the pruning solution:

```python
import struct

# Read the binary weight file
with open('/workspace/model_weights.dat', 'rb') as f:
    weights = []
    while True:
        data = f.read(4)  # Read 4 bytes for one float
        if not data:
            break
        weight = struct.unpack('<f', data)[0]
        weights.append(weight)

# Prune weights with absolute value < 0.15
threshold = 0.15
pruned_weights = []
weights_pruned_count = 0
weights_remaining_count = 0

for weight in weights:
    if abs(weight) < threshold:
        pruned_weights.append(0.0)
        weights_pruned_count += 1
    else:
        pruned_weights.append(weight)
        weights_remaining_count += 1

# Calculate statistics
total_weights = len(weights)
sparsity_percent = (weights_pruned_count / total_weights) * 100
original_size_bytes = total_weights * 4
pruned_size_bytes = total_weights * 4

# Write pruned weights to file
with open('/workspace/pruned_weights.dat', 'wb') as f:
    for weight in pruned_weights:
        f.write(struct.pack('<f', weight))

# Write report
report = f"""WEIGHTS_PRUNED={weights_pruned_count}
WEIGHTS_REMAINING={weights_remaining_count}
SPARSITY_PERCENT={sparsity_percent:.2f}
ORIGINAL_SIZE_BYTES={original_size_bytes}
PRUNED_SIZE_BYTES={pruned_size_bytes}
"""

with open('/workspace/pruning_report.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(report)

print("Pruning complete!")
print(report)
