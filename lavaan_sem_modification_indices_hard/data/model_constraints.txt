THEORETICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR SEM MODEL MODIFICATIONS
=========================================================

CROSS-LOADING CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------
Items should not load on multiple factors. Cross-loadings violate our theoretical framework.
Each item was designed to measure a single construct, and allowing cross-loadings would 
compromise the discriminant validity of our factors. Any modification suggesting an item 
loading on a factor other than its intended factor (e.g., item1 =~ Factor2, item8 =~ Factor1) 
should be REJECTED.

RESIDUAL COVARIANCES WITHIN FACTORS
------------------------------------
Residual covariances between items within the same factor ARE acceptable if items share 
method variance or similar wording. For example:
- Items on the same subscale with parallel wording structure
- Items presented adjacently in the survey that may have context effects
- Items measuring the same facet of a broader construct

These within-factor error correlations can improve model fit without violating theory.

FACTOR COVARIANCES
------------------
Factor covariances are acceptable as our theory allows constructs to correlate.
All factors in our model (Factor1, Factor2, Factor3) are expected to have some degree of 
relationship. Modifications suggesting factor covariances (Factor1 ~~ Factor2, etc.) are 
theoretically justified and should be considered if MI values are high.

CROSS-FACTOR ITEM COVARIANCES
------------------------------
Do NOT add covariances between items from different factors unless they are reverse-coded pairs.
Most cross-factor item covariances would suggest construct overlap that violates our theoretical
model. The ONLY acceptable cross-factor item covariances are between reverse-coded pairs:
- item3 with item7 (both reverse-coded measures of related concepts)
- item5 with item12 (reverse-coded pair)
- item2 with item9 (reverse-coded pair)

Any other cross-factor item covariances should be REJECTED regardless of MI value.

ERROR TERM COVARIANCES
----------------------
Error covariances using explicit error term notation (e1 ~~ e2 format) are generally NOT 
acceptable unless between reverse-coded items. Our model specifies item-level covariances
directly, so error term modifications should be avoided to maintain model clarity.
