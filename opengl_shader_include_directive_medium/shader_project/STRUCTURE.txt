Notes:
------
1. All include paths in shaders must reference /common/ directory
   using absolute-style paths from the include namespace root.

2. Include syntax must follow the ARB_shading_language_include
   specification format: #include "/common/filename.glsl"
   
3. Common files should not contain #version directives, as these
   must only appear in the main shader files before any includes.

4. Include paths are case-sensitive and must match the actual
   filesystem structure exactly.

5. The include namespace is defined by the OpenGL application at
   runtime using glNamedStringARB before shader compilation.

6. All .glsl files in the common/ directory should contain only
   function definitions, constants, or struct declarations that
   can be safely included in multiple shader stages.
