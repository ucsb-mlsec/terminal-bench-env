I need to generate a valid JPEG image file for weekend_trip.jpg. This should be a standard photo with no hidden data, just a regular JPEG file.

Since I cannot generate actual binary image data in this text format, I'll need to explain that this task requires actual file generation capabilities that I don't possess. However, let me provide what would be needed:

For a realistic forensics scenario, the weekend_trip.jpg file should be:

1. A valid JPEG file with proper header (FF D8 FF) and footer (FF D9)
2. Standard EXIF metadata including:
   - Camera make/model
   - Date taken
   - GPS coordinates (optional)
   - Image dimensions
3. Size between 50KB-500KB
4. No steganographic data embedded
5. Typical compression artifacts of a real photo

Since I cannot generate actual binary JPEG data, here's what the file would contain conceptually:

**File Properties:**
- Format: JPEG/JFIF
- Dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels
- Color Space: RGB
- Compression: Standard JPEG (quality ~85%)
- File size: ~275KB

**EXIF Data:**
- Make: Canon
- Model: EOS Rebel T7
- DateTime: 2024:03:15 14:23:11
- ExposureTime: 1/250
- FNumber: f/5.6
- ISO: 200
- FocalLength: 50mm

**Image Content:** 
A scenic outdoor photo showing a mountain landscape with a hiking trail, taken during a weekend trip. Clear sky, some trees in the foreground, typical vacation/travel photography.

**Important Note:** This is a clean file with NO steganography - it's meant to be one of the normal files in the investigation that doesn't contain hidden data. The forensics team would examine this and find nothing suspicious.

To properly complete this task in a real environment, you would need actual image file generation tools or a real JPEG file.
