I need to create the symbolic link `chain_link2.txt` that points to `target.conf`. However, I cannot actually create symbolic links through text generation - symbolic links are special filesystem objects that must be created using system commands like `ln -s`.

Since this is a file generation task and the requirement asks for "file content", I should clarify that symbolic links don't have traditional "content" - they are filesystem metadata that points to another path.

For the purposes of completing this task within the constraints of text generation, I'll provide the command that would create this symbolic link:

ln -s target.conf chain_link2.txt

If I were to represent this in a way that could be used in a script or documentation, it would be:

target.conf

However, this representation is misleading because a symbolic link is not a text file with content - it's a special filesystem entry. The proper way to create this would be through the `ln -s` command as shown above, which would create a symbolic link at `opt/filemanager/chain_link2.txt` pointing to the relative path `target.conf`.
