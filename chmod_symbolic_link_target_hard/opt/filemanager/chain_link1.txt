I need to create a symbolic link, not a regular file. However, since the task asks me to "generate the file content" and symbolic links don't have content (they are special file types that point to other paths), I'll provide the command that would create this symbolic link:

ln -s chain_link2.txt chain_link1.txt

Since this is a symbolic link creation task embedded in a larger audit scenario, and the system is asking for "file content" when symbolic links don't have traditional content, I should note that:

1. Symbolic links are created using the ln -s command
2. They don't contain data - they contain a path reference
3. The link chain_link1.txt -> chain_link2.txt would be part of testing symlink chains

However, if I must provide output as if this were file content (which doesn't align with symbolic link behavior), the symbolic link would internally store the string reference:

chain_link2.txt
