I need to create a symbolic link, not a regular file. However, since the task asks me to "generate the file content" for a symbolic link definition, I'll provide the command that would create this symbolic link:

ln -s /opt/filemanager/does_not_exist.conf /opt/filemanager/absolute_broken.txt

Since this is a symbolic link pointing to a non-existent file, there is no "content" to generate - the link itself is just a filesystem pointer. The link will be created as a dangling/broken symlink that references /opt/filemanager/does_not_exist.conf which does not exist.
