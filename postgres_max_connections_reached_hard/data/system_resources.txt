MEMORY AVAILABILITY SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total RAM: 16384MB
Allocated:
  - PostgreSQL shared_buffers: 2048MB
  - PostgreSQL processes: 1536MB
  - Current connections (95): 750MB
  - OS and services: 2048MB
  - Total Allocated: 6382MB

Available for Growth:
  - Free memory: ~10GB (10240MB)
  - Usable for additional connections: 9-10GB
  - Maximum theoretical connections (at 8MB each): ~1280

CONNECTION OVERHEAD ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Per-Connection Memory Requirements:
  - Minimum overhead: 5MB (idle connection)
  - Average overhead: 7-8MB (active connection)
  - Maximum overhead: 10MB (complex query connection)

Current Connection Memory Usage:
  - 95 active connections
  - Average 7.9MB per connection
  - Total: ~750MB

Projected Memory for Increased Connections:
  - 200 connections: ~1.6GB
  - 300 connections: ~2.4GB
  - 500 connections: ~4.0GB
  - 1000 connections: ~8.0GB
  - 1500 connections: ~12.0GB

RESOURCE CAPACITY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
Safe Operating Parameters:
  - Maximum connections (with current shared_buffers): 1200-1400
  - Recommended maximum for stability: 1000
  - Conservative recommendation: 500-800

Memory Headroom:
  - Current available: 10GB
  - Recommended reserve: 2GB (for OS cache and spikes)
  - Usable for connections: 8GB
  - Connections supportable: ~1000 at 8MB each

CPU Capacity:
  - 8 cores available
  - Rule of thumb: connections = cores * 100-150
  - Suggested range: 800-1200 connections

DISK I/O CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================
SSD Performance Characteristics:
  - Random IOPS: >50,000 (sufficient for high connection count)
  - Sequential throughput: >500MB/s
  - Latency: <1ms
  - Connection count NOT limited by disk I/O

Current Disk Usage:
  - 64% utilized (healthy)
  - Growth headroom available
  - No immediate I/O bottleneck concerns
