<h1>Understanding Modern Web Security Practices</h1>

<p>Web security has become increasingly important as applications handle more sensitive user data. In this article, we'll explore some fundamental concepts that every developer should understand.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Input Validation</h3>

<p>One of the most critical aspects of web security is <strong>proper input validation</strong>. Never trust user input, whether it comes from forms, URLs, or API requests. As the saying goes:</p>

<blockquote>
All input is evil until proven otherwise. Validate, sanitize, and escape everything.
</blockquote>

<h3>Common Vulnerability Types</h3>

<p>Modern web applications face several types of security threats. Here are the most common ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks</li>
<li>SQL Injection vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
<li>Authentication and session management flaws</li>
<li>Insecure direct object references</li>
</ul>

<h4>XSS Prevention Techniques</h4>

<p>When handling user-generated content, always use proper sanitization libraries. For example, in Python you might use <code>bleach</code> or similar tools. Here's a simple approach:</p>

<pre><code>import html

def sanitize_input(user_input):
    return html.escape(user_input)
</code></pre>

<p>However, for rich text content, you'll need more sophisticated solutions that preserve <em>legitimate formatting</em> while blocking malicious code.</p>

<h3>Security Headers and Best Practices</h3>

<p>Beyond input sanitization, implementing proper security headers is essential. Consider using:</p>

<ol>
<li>Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers</li>
<li>X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking</li>
<li>Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement</li>
<li>X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing</li>
</ol>

<h4>Defense in Depth</h4>

<p>Remember that security is not a single solution but rather <b>layers of protection</b>. Combine multiple strategies:<br>input validation, output encoding, security headers, and regular security audits.</p>
