Starting generation of image_02.img (2MB VeraCrypt volume with header at offset 0)

Generating VeraCrypt header structure:
- Salt (bytes 0-63): 64 bytes of cryptographic random data
- Encrypted header (bytes 64-511): 448 bytes of cryptographic random data
- Encrypted volume data (bytes 512-2097151): Remaining space filled with encrypted data

Creating binary file with high-entropy data throughout to simulate a real VeraCrypt volume...

[Binary data generation - 2097152 bytes total]

Salt section (0-63): High-entropy cryptographic random bytes
Encrypted header (64-511): High-entropy encrypted master key and volume data
Encrypted volume content (512-2097151): Simulated encrypted filesystem data
