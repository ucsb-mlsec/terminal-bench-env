# Stack Safety Configuration Guidelines
# Embedded Firmware Project - Rev 2.3

## System Constraints

Total Stack Allocation: 4096 bytes
This allocation must be shared across the entire call chain including interrupt handlers.

## Safety Thresholds

CRITICAL: Any single function consuming more than 512 bytes of stack space is considered
dangerous and MUST be flagged for immediate review by the senior embedded systems team.

Functions approaching this threshold should be refactored to use dynamic allocation or
static buffers where appropriate. Deep recursion is prohibited in production code.

## Analysis Requirements

Stack usage analysis must be performed on every release candidate build using GCC's
-fstack-usage flag. All .su files must be archived with the release documentation.
