[2024-01-15 14:32:48] ERROR: SSH connection parameters may be incorrect
[2024-01-15 14:32:48] Common issues: incorrect port, wrong username, timeout too short
[2024-01-15 14:32:48] 
[2024-01-15 14:32:48] Suggested actions:
[2024-01-15 14:32:48]   - Verify SSH port configuration in inventory
[2024-01-15 14:32:48]   - Check ansible_user settings
[2024-01-15 14:32:48]   - Increase connection timeout if needed
[2024-01-15 14:32:48]   - Confirm hosts are using custom SSH ports
