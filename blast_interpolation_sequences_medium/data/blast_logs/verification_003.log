Computing interpolants for refinement...

Interpolation sequence:
Interpolant at location 1: i == 0
Interpolant at location 2: sum == 0
Interpolant at location 3: max == 100
Interpolant at location 4: i <= 20 && sum >= 0
Interpolant at location 5: sum == i*(i-1)/2
Interpolant at location 6: i >= 1 && sum >= 0
Interpolant at location 7: i <= 20
Interpolant at location 8: sum == i*(i-1)/2 && i <= 20
Interpolant at location 9: i >= 2 && sum >= 1
Interpolant at location 10: sum > 0 && i > 0
