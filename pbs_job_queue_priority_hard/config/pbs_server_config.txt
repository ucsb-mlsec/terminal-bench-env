File: data/current_queue_state.txt
Requirements: A PBS job queue listing showing current jobs. Format should mimic 'qstat -f' output style. Include 10-12 jobs with these attributes for each: Job Id (format: ####.pbs-server), Job_Name, Job_Owner (with group in username like user@genomics or user@physics), job_state (Q for queued, R for running), queue (batch/express/long), Resource_List.nodes (1-8 nodes), Resource_List.walltime (various times), qtime (submission time in format: Mon Dec 16 HH:MM:SS YYYY - vary these so some are >24 hours old, some recent), comment (some should say things like "Not Running: Insufficient resources" or "Job held by user"). Make times realistic relative to current timestamp of Wed Dec 18 14:30:00 2024. Include a mix: some genomics group jobs that should be high priority but are queued, some physics jobs, some regular users. Some small jobs (1-3 nodes), some large (5-8 nodes). Some old submissions (Dec 15-16), some new (Dec 18). Make 3-4 jobs Running (R) and the rest Queued (Q). Format with proper indentation like real qstat output.

Generate the file content.

Requirements:
- Follow all requirements exactly
- Generate realistic content
- DO NOT wrap output in ``` markers
