# PBS Fair-share Configuration
# This file defines resource allocation shares for different research groups
# Fair-share factor is calculated based on shares allocated vs. actual usage
# Higher fairshare factor = higher job priority for that group

# Root entity - total cluster allocation
root fairshare=100 usage=500

  # Genomics research group - high priority projects
  # ERROR: shares set too low for critical research group
  genomics fairshare=10 usage=120
  genomics shares=10
  genomics fairshare_factor=0.75

  # Physics research group - medium priority
  physics fairshare=15 usage=200
  physics shares=15
  physics fairshare_factor=0.68
  
  # Chemistry research group - standard priority
  chemistry fairshare=25 usage=80
  chemistry shares=25
  chemistry fairshare_factor=1.45
  # ERROR: fairshare_entity parameter missing for chemistry group
  
  # General users - lowest priority
  general fairshare=50 usage=100
  general shares=50
  general fairshare_entity=1
  general fairshare_factor=1.85

# Fair-share scheduling parameters
# ERROR: usage_factor disabled - historical usage not factored into priority
usage_factor=0
usage_decay_factor=0.95

# ERROR: decay parameter too high - penalizes groups unfairly for past usage
# Should be between 0.5-0.7 for weekly decay, currently set to 0.95
fairshare_decay_time=168
fairshare_decay_factor=0.95

# Fairshare recalculation interval (seconds)
fairshare_update_interval=300

# Note: genomics group should have shares=40 minimum given their critical priority status
# Note: usage_factor=0 means fairshare system essentially disabled
