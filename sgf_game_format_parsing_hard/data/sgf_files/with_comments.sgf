This game demonstrates modern opening theory and proper direction of play. Pay attention to the balance between territory and influence throughout.];B[pd]C[Traditional corner approach. The 4-4 point is the most flexible opening move, emphasizing influence over immediate territory.];W[dp]C[Parallel opening. White mirrors Black's choice, leading to a balanced game where fighting ability will be crucial.];B[pp]C[Black takes a second corner with the same philosophy. This sets up for potential Chinese or Kobayashi fuseki patterns.];W[dd]C[White completes the symmetrical opening. All four corners now have 4-4 stones, guaranteeing a complex middle game.];B[fq]C[Low Chinese opening. This move works perfectly with the stones at Q4 and Q16, creating a framework on the right side.];W[cn]C[Standard response. White prevents Black from settling easily while developing the left side. The low approach is solid and prevents undermining moves.](;B[jp]C[Completing the formation. This is the signature move of the low Chinese opening, creating a stable yet expansive moyo on the lower right.];W[qn]C[Approaching the corner. White must invade or reduce Black's framework before it becomes overwhelming. This is the right timing.];B[nq]C[Solid extension. Black reinforces the corner while maintaining pressure on the White stone. This move is thick and reliable.];W[rp]C[Settling shape. White needs a base to survive. This move aims for life in the corner while preparing to escape into the center.];B[qq]C[Taking profit. Black is happy to let White live small while securing substantial corner territory. The exchange favors Black strategically.];W[nc]C[Invasion! White cannot allow Black to dominate the upper side as well. This move aims to erase Black's territorial potential.];B[pf]C[Solid response. Black builds a framework while keeping pressure on the invading stone. This move works well with Q16.](;W[pb]C[Standard continuation. White secures the corner and establishes a base. This is joseki and gives White stable shape.];B[qc]C[Taking the corner. Black accepts the trade, securing solid territory while White gets outside influence. Good judgment.];W[kc]C[Extending to complete the base. White's group is now stable and has good shape. The position is playable for both sides.];B[cj]C[Expanding to the left side. Black stakes a claim on the remaining large area. This move prevents White from dominating the left.];W[cf]C[Natural extension. White develops the upper left while preparing to pressure the Black stone at C10.];B[cm]C[Jumping into White's sphere. This aggressive move seeks to destabilize White's position and create complications.];W[dm]C[Strong resistance. White cuts off Black's escape route and aims to attack severely. The fight begins.];B[dn]C[Fighting back! Black tries to break through White's position. This leads to complex variations requiring careful reading.];W[co]C[Protecting the corner. White must keep the position connected while continuing the attack on Black.];B[dl]C[Extending while under attack. Black needs eye space and running room. This move is urgent.];W[em]C[Continuing the pressure. White builds thickness while chasing Black. Good attacking technique.];B[el]C[Running to the center. Black has no choice but to escape. The weak group needs immediate attention.];W[fm]C[Pursuing relentlessly. White's thickness is growing and Black's group remains unstable.];B[ci]C[Making shape. Black creates eye potential while reaching toward the upper side. The group is becoming more viable.];W[jd]C[Expanding the moyo. White uses the attacking sequence to develop a large upper side framework. Excellent technique.];B[qj]C[Securing the right side. Black takes territory while the game remains balanced. Both players have achieved reasonable positions.])(;W[jd]C[Alternative - more influence oriented. This move emphasizes central control over corner security. It's a fighting choice.];B[lc]C[Splitting attack. Black must challenge White's thin position immediately. This move creates complications favoring Black's strength.];W[le]C[Jumping out. White refuses to be captured and aims for the center. The fight will determine the game's direction.];B[pb]C[Securing the corner. Black takes profit while White struggles for stability. This seems favorable for Black.];W[mc]C[Fighting for life. White needs to connect or make two eyes. The position is dangerous.];B[lb]C[Maintaining pressure. Black keeps White separated and weak. The attack continues with good prospects.];W[ne]C[Escaping to the center. White must run and hope to complicate the position. The game has become a difficult fight.]))(;B[dr]C[Different plan - taking the corner. This move prioritizes immediate profit over framework play. It's more territorial.];W[cq]C[Natural response. White defends the corner while keeping pressure on Black's stones.];B[iq]C[Establishing a base. Black makes stable shape along the bottom. This is less ambitious than the low Chinese but very solid.];W[qf]C[Fast approach. White takes the initiative on the right side, aiming to prevent Black from building a large moyo.];B[nd]C[Pincer and extension. Black attacks White while developing the upper side. This move serves multiple purposes efficiently.];W[pj]C[Jumping out. White avoids confinement and aims for the center. The position remains complex with chances for both sides.];B[rd]C[Securing the corner. Black takes solid territory and removes White's invasion potential. Safe and profitable.];W[qi]C[Settling shape.

Good timing.];W[hd]C[Pincer! White uses the upper side stones to create a severe attack while developing territory.];B[cc]C[Standard invasion. Black seeks life in the corner, which is the usual continuation in this pattern.];W[dc]C[Blocking on the wider side. White maintains pressure while protecting the corner.];B[cd]C[Extending for eye space. Black needs to settle quickly to avoid being overwhelmed.];W[ce]C[Pushing through. White builds thickness while Black struggles for life.];B[db]C[Fighting for the corner. Black seeks eye space with this standard tesuji.]))
