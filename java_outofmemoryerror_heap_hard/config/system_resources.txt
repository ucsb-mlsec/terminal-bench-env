SYSTEM RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS DOCUMENTATION
==============================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document outlines the system resource constraints and requirements for the
bioinformatics pipeline Java services experiencing memory issues during nightly
data processing runs.

TOTAL SYSTEM RESOURCES
----------------------
* Total System RAM: 16GB (16384MB)
* Available for JVM Heap Allocation: 12GB (12288MB)
* Reserved for OS and non-heap operations: 4GB (4096MB)

RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------
* Number of Java services: 3
  - genomics-parser
  - sequence-aligner
  - variant-caller

* Minimum heap per service: 512MB
* Maximum total heap allocation: 12288MB (12GB)
* Combined heap allocation must not exceed the 12GB threshold

CURRENT ISSUES
--------------
* Problem: OutOfMemoryError exceptions during nightly processing runs
* Impact: Service crashes and failed data processing jobs
* Frequency: Occurring during peak loads with large genomic datasets
* Root cause: Insufficient heap memory allocation for workload demands

MEMORY ALLOCATION GUIDELINES
-----------------------------
* Heap sizes must be determined based on actual peak usage from logs
* Add 20-30% overhead above peak usage to accommodate garbage collection
* GC overhead prevents the heap from operating at maximum capacity continuously
* Typical recommendation: Use 25% overhead for optimal performance

GARBAGE COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------
* Java GC requires additional headroom beyond application peak usage
* Insufficient overhead leads to frequent GC cycles and potential OOM errors
* Recommended overhead range: 20-30% above observed peak heap usage
* Example: If peak usage is 2000MB, allocate 2400-2600MB heap

SERVICE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------
* genomics-parser: Handles initial parsing of raw genomic sequence files
* sequence-aligner: Performs alignment operations (typically most memory-intensive)
* variant-caller: Identifies genetic variants from aligned sequences

Each service processes data of varying sizes depending on input dataset
characteristics. Memory requirements scale with input data volume.

ALLOCATION STRATEGY
-------------------
1. Analyze memory usage logs to identify peak heap usage per service
2. Calculate required heap with GC overhead (peak usage × 1.25)
3. Verify total allocation does not exceed 12288MB
4. Ensure each service has at least 512MB minimum
5. Allocate proportionally based on workload requirements

VALIDATION CHECKLIST
--------------------
□ Total heap allocation ≤ 12288MB
□ Each service heap ≥ 512MB
□ GC overhead (20-30%) included in calculations
□ Peak usage patterns from logs analyzed
□ Configuration tested during typical workload scenarios
