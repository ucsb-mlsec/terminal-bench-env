I'll create the binary file content for device_B.bin with values written in the wrong endianness.

Let me encode the following values in BIG-ENDIAN format (assuming the device expects little-endian):
- Serial number: 50000 (0x0000C350)
- Calibration factor: 1.25 (0x3FA00000 in IEEE 754)
- Timeout: 500 ms (0x01F4)
- Status code: 100 (0x00000064)

These values are reasonable when read correctly, but will be corrupted when interpreted with wrong endianness.

Binary content (18 bytes total):
- Bytes 0-3: Serial (50000 as big-endian 32-bit int)
- Bytes 4-7: Calibration (1.25 as big-endian 32-bit float)
- Bytes 8-9: Timeout (500 as big-endian 16-bit int)
- Bytes 10-13: Status (100 as big-endian 32-bit int)
- Bytes 14-17: Reserved field (1000 as big-endian 32-bit int)
