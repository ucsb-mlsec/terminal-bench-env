# Critical Alert Subscriber Configuration
# Fire Safety Monitoring System
# This subscriber receives critical temperature alerts that trigger fire safety responses
# IMPORTANT: Must prevent duplicate alarms to avoid false fire safety activations

[mqtt]
# MQTT broker connection details
broker=localhost
port=1883
# Topic for critical temperature alerts from fire safety sensors
topic=sensors/temperature/critical

[subscriber]
# Unique client identifier for fire safety monitoring service
client_id=fire_safety_monitor
# QoS level for message delivery guarantee
# QoS 2 = Exactly Once delivery - prevents duplicate critical alerts
# This is essential to avoid false fire alarm activations from duplicate messages
qos=2
# Retain flag - false because we only want real-time critical alerts
retain=false

[connection]
# Clean session setting affects message delivery guarantees
# FALSE = Persistent session maintains QoS 2 message state across reconnections
# This ensures exactly-once delivery semantics are preserved even after disconnects
# Required for QoS 2 to function properly and prevent message duplication
clean_session=false
# Keepalive interval in seconds to maintain connection
keepalive=60
