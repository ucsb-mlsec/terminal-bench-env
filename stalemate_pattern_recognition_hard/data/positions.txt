I'll analyze each chess position to determine if White can accidentally cause a stalemate.

Let me examine each position:

**Position 1: 8/8/8/8/8/5K2/6Q1/6k1 w - - 0 1**
- White King on f3, Queen on g2, Black King on g1
- If White plays Qg3 or Qh2 or similar moves that don't give check, Black king on g1 would have no moves (h1, h2, f1, f2 all controlled) = STALEMATE possible
- DANGER

**Position 2: 8/8/8/8/8/3K4/3Q4/3k4 w - - 0 1**
- White King on d3, Queen on d2, Black King on d1
- If White plays Qc2, Qe2, or other moves blocking without check, Black king trapped = STALEMATE possible
- DANGER

**Position 3: 8/8/8/8/3k4/8/3K4/3R4 w - - 0 1**
- White King on d2, Rook on d1, Black King on d4
- Black king has many squares (c3, c4, c5, d3, d5, e3, e4, e5)
- Hard to trap with one rook move
- SAFE

**Position 4: 8/8/8/3k4/8/3K4/8/3Q4 w - - 0 1**
- White King on d3, Queen on d1, Black King on d5
- Black king has squares available (c4, c5, c6, d6, e4, e5, e6)
- Queen moves are unlikely to trap completely in one move
- SAFE

**Position 5: 8/8/8/8/2k5/8/1K6/1R6 w - - 0 1**
- White King on b2, Rook on b1, Black King on c4
- Black king has many escape squares
- SAFE

**Position 6: 8/8/8/2k5/8/2K5/8/2Q5 w - - 0 1**
- White King on c3, Queen on c1, Black King on c5
- If White plays Qb2, Qd2, or other non-checking moves, Black king still has b4, b5, b6, d4, d5, d6
- SAFE

1=DANGER
2=DANGER
3=SAFE
4=SAFE
5=SAFE
6=SAFE
