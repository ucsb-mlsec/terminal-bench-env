# Trinity RNA-seq Assembly Configuration File
# This file contains parameters for Trinity de novo transcriptome assembly

# Maximum memory allocation for Trinity process
# Current setting is too high for available cluster resources
--max_memory 64G

# Minimum k-mer coverage threshold
# Lower values retain more k-mers but increase memory usage significantly
# Current value of 1 causes excessive memory consumption
--min_kmer_cov 1

# Number of CPU threads to use for parallel processing
# Higher thread counts can increase memory overhead per thread
--CPU 16

# Butterfly options for graph compaction and traversal
# -V: verbosity level
# --edge-thr: edge threshold for graph pruning
--bfly_opts "-V 10 --edge-thr=0.1 --stderr"

# In silico normalization maximum read coverage
# Higher values retain more reads but increase memory requirements
--normalize_max_read_cov 200

# Normalize reads by read set before assembly
# This can help reduce memory but depends on coverage
--normalize_by_read_set

# Remove all intermediate files after assembly completes
--full_cleanup

# Sequence type specification (fq = FASTQ format)
--seqType fq

# Strand-specific library type
# RF = first read reverse strand, second read forward strand
--SS_lib_type RF
