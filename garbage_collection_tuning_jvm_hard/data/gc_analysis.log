GC ANALYSIS REPORT - Incident Date: 2024-01-15

================================================================================
CURRENT CONFIGURATION
================================================================================
Garbage Collector: Parallel GC (ParallelOldGC)
Heap Size: -Xmx2g -Xms2g
Other JVM Flags: -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200

================================================================================
GC PAUSE STATISTICS
================================================================================
Average Minor GC pause time: 38ms
Maximum Minor GC pause time: 95ms
Average Full GC pause time: 920ms
Maximum Full GC pause time: 1450ms
Minor GC frequency: every 2.8 seconds
Full GC frequency: 15 times per hour (during peak traffic)

================================================================================
HEAP UTILIZATION
================================================================================
Young Generation:
  - Average utilization: 72%
  - Peak utilization: 98%

Old Generation:
  - Average utilization: 88%
  - Peak utilization: 96%

Peak heap usage during incident: 1.92GB out of 2GB (96% utilization)

Metaspace usage: 145MB (stable)

================================================================================
MEMORY ALLOCATION RATE
================================================================================
Average allocation rate: 425MB/sec
Peak allocation rate: 580MB/sec during high traffic periods

================================================================================
KEY OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================
1. Old generation consistently above 85% utilization, triggering frequent full GCs
2. Full GC pause times averaging 920ms significantly exceed acceptable thresholds
3. Full GC frequency increased from 3/hour to 15/hour during peak traffic
4. Heap pressure evident with 96% peak utilization - insufficient headroom
5. Stop-the-world Full GC pauses causing request timeouts and user-visible latency
6. Young generation collections performing adequately but promoting too many objects to old gen

================================================================================
IMPACT SUMMARY
================================================================================
- 15 incidents of request timeouts correlating with Full GC events
- Average response time degraded from 180ms to 850ms during GC pauses
- Application throughput dropped by 40% during peak incident window
- CPU time spent in GC: 18% (target: <5%)
