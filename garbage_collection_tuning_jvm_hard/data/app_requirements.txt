APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS - Production Environment

========================================
RESPONSE TIME SLA
========================================
95th percentile response time: < 150ms
99th percentile response time: < 300ms
Maximum acceptable latency: 500ms
GC pause time budget: < 50ms for minor GC, < 150ms for any GC

========================================
SYSTEM RESOURCES
========================================
Available RAM: 16GB
Available CPU cores: 8 cores
Container memory limit: 8GB
Recommended heap allocation: 50-70% of container memory

========================================
EXPECTED HEAP USAGE
========================================
Minimum required heap: 3GB
Recommended heap: 4GB
Maximum heap (if more resources available): 6GB
Expected live set size: 2.5GB

========================================
THROUGHPUT REQUIREMENTS
========================================
Expected requests per second: 2000-3000 RPS during peak
Object allocation rate: high - 400-600MB/sec
Application type: Latency-sensitive web application
Acceptable GC overhead: < 3% of total CPU time

========================================
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
========================================
- Serves real-time user-facing API requests with strict SLA commitments
- Requires consistent low latency with minimal variance in response times
- Cannot tolerate GC pauses exceeding 150ms as they directly impact customer experience
- High allocation rate due to request processing and JSON serialization/deserialization
