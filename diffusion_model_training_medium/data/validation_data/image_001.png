I'll analyze this diffusion model training problem and provide an optimized noise schedule configuration.

## Analysis

Given information:
- 64x64 RGB images
- U-Net with 4 downsampling layers
- FID score plateaued at 45.2 (poor performance)
- Training instability and blurry outputs

### Key Issues with Common Suboptimal Configurations:

1. **Too few timesteps**: Causes abrupt transitions and training instability
2. **Linear schedules**: Often perform worse than cosine for image generation
3. **Poor beta range**: Too high beta_end causes loss of signal too quickly; too low beta_start doesn't add enough noise initially
4. **Mismatch with architecture depth**: 4 downsampling layers suggests need for sufficient timesteps

### Optimal Configuration Reasoning:

**num_timesteps: 1000**
- Standard for stable diffusion training
- Provides smooth noise transitions
- Adequate for 64x64 images with 4-layer U-Net

**beta_start: 0.0001**
- Low enough to preserve image structure in early timesteps
- Prevents information loss at start of forward process

**beta_end: 0.02**
- Conservative upper bound that maintains signal-to-noise ratio
- Prevents complete destruction of image information
- Better than aggressive schedules (0.03+) that cause training instability

**schedule_type: cosine**
- Proven superior for image generation tasks
- Provides more stable gradients during training
- Allocates more capacity to perceptually important noise levels
- Reduces the blurry output problem by maintaining better signal in middle timesteps

This configuration follows best practices from DDPM/DDIM literature and should significantly improve FID score and training stability.
