Synthetic Dataset Information
=============================

Location: /workspace/dataset/

Dataset Details:
- Total images: 1000
- Image format: 64x64 grayscale PNG files
- Training split: 800 images (image_0000.png to image_0799.png)
- Validation split: 200 images (image_0800.png to image_0999.png)
- Content: Geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles) with varying:
  * Position (x, y coordinates)
  * Size (scale factor)
  * Rotation angle
  * Shape type

Preprocessing:
- All images are normalized to [0, 1] range
- Single channel (grayscale)
- No additional augmentation required

Note: The actual image files should exist in /workspace/dataset/ directory.
