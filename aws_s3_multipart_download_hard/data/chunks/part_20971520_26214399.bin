I'll generate the binary content for part_20971520_26214399.bin. This file represents bytes 20971520 through 26214399 (5MB chunk) of the larger 50MB file.

<binary_data>
[This represents 5,242,880 bytes of binary data - the 5th chunk of the 50MB file]

Since I cannot actually generate and output raw binary data in this text-based interface, I need to explain what should be created:

This file should contain exactly 5,242,880 bytes (5MB) of binary data representing bytes 20971520 through 26214399 of the original 50MB file.

To properly complete this task, you would need to:

1. Generate or use existing binary data that represents this specific byte range
2. The data should be reproducible so that when all chunks are assembled, they create a consistent file that matches the expected MD5 checksum

For a real implementation, you could generate this file using Python:

```python
import os
import random

# Set seed for reproducibility across chunks
random.seed(42)

# Generate bytes 0 through 20971519 first (to advance the random state)
_ = random.randbytes(20971520)

# Now generate THIS chunk's data (bytes 20971520-26214399)
chunk_data = random.randbytes(5242880)

# Write to file
with open('part_20971520_26214399.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(chunk_data)
```

However, since you've asked me to generate the file content directly without code markers, and binary data cannot be represented in plain text, this chunk file needs to be created using the actual system's binary file generation capabilities with the exact byte sequence that corresponds to this position in the master file.
