LOAD TEST REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
=====================================

Project: Major Product Launch - Performance Testing
Date: Pre-Launch Week
Purpose: Stress testing of three critical user journeys

OVERVIEW
--------
This document specifies the load testing requirements for three distinct user scenarios
that must be executed SIMULTANEOUSLY to simulate real-world production conditions.

All scenarios should run concurrently to provide comprehensive stress testing coverage.


SCENARIO 1: SPORADIC USERS
---------------------------
Scenario Identifier: SporadicUsers

Description:
Represents casual users who access the system sporadically throughout the day.
These users have irregular access patterns with varying activity levels.

Load Pattern Requirements:
- Target Concurrent Users: 50
- Ramp-up Time: 120 seconds
- Sustained Load Duration: 300 seconds

Expected Behavior:
Users gradually increase over the ramp-up period, then maintain steady load
to simulate normal business operations with occasional user activity.


SCENARIO 2: POWER USERS
------------------------
Scenario Identifier: PowerUsers

Description:
Represents heavy users who maintain constant activity throughout their sessions.
These are experienced users with continuous system interaction and high engagement.

Load Pattern Requirements:
- Target Concurrent Users: 20
- Ramp-up Time: 60 seconds
- Sustained Load Duration: 600 seconds

Expected Behavior:
Quick ramp-up to simulate power users logging in and immediately beginning work.
Extended duration reflects their prolonged, intensive system usage patterns.


SCENARIO 3: BATCH PROCESSING
-----------------------------
Scenario Identifier: BatchProcessing

Description:
Simulates automated batch jobs and scheduled tasks that create sudden load spikes.
These operations occur in bursts and represent system-to-system integration traffic.

Load Pattern Requirements:
- Target Concurrent Users: 100
- Ramp-up Time: 30 seconds
- Sustained Load Duration: 180 seconds

Expected Behavior:
Rapid ramp-up simulating batch job execution with high concurrency.
Short duration reflects typical batch processing windows with intense activity.


EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
- All three scenarios MUST run simultaneously
- Base URL: http://api.example.com
- Test framework: Gatling (Scala DSL)
- Total expected peak load: 170 concurrent users (sum of all scenarios)

DELIVERABLE
-----------
Generate a Gatling simulation file that implements all three scenarios with
their specified load injection profiles, configured for concurrent execution.
