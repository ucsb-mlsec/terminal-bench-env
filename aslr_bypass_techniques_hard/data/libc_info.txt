libc Function Offset Information
========================================

This file documents static function offsets within the C standard library (libc.so.6).
These offsets represent the distance from libc's base load address to each function.
Offsets remain constant regardless of ASLR and can be used to calculate runtime base addresses.

Format: function_name: 0xOFFSET

Standard C Library Functions:
------------------------------

__libc_start_main: 0x24580
malloc: 0x8d120
free: 0x8e340
calloc: 0x8f120
realloc: 0x90a50
printf: 0xa3210
fprintf: 0xa4880
sprintf: 0xa5120
snprintf: 0xa5670
strlen: 0x9a440
strcpy: 0x9b120
strncpy: 0x9b890
memcpy: 0x98320
memset: 0x99a40
fopen: 0xc1240
fclose: 0xc2110
fread: 0xc2890
fwrite: 0xc3120
read: 0x110a20
write: 0x110b80
open: 0x110320
close: 0x110480

Note: These offsets are derived from the libc binary analysis and represent
static positions within the library. When combined with runtime addresses
from crash dumps or stack traces, they can be used to determine the actual
base address where libc was loaded in memory.
