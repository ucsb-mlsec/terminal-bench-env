Application Binary Function Offset Documentation
=======================================================

This file documents the static offsets of functions within the main
application binary. These offsets are measured from the binary's base
address and remain constant regardless of ASLR.

Format: function_name: 0xOFFSET

Function Offsets:
-----------------

init_server: 0x1a40
main: 0x2340
parse_config: 0x3780
handle_connection: 0x3a120
authenticate_user: 0x45c0
validate_data: 0x4890
process_request: 0x4c890
parse_input: 0x5f120
database_query: 0x67340
error_handler: 0x73a80
log_message: 0x7b200
cleanup_resources: 0x82c40
session_manager: 0x8f560
crypto_handler: 0x9a1c0
shutdown_server: 0xa4780

NOTE: These offsets are static and compiled into the binary.
To calculate the runtime address of any function, add its offset
to the actual base address where the binary was loaded in memory.

Runtime Address = Base Address + Static Offset
