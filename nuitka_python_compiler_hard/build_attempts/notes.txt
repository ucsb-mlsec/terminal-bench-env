Build Notes - Calculator Compilation Issues
========================================

Been trying to compile calculator.py into a standalone exe for the past few days. Major headaches.

Problems Encountered:
- First attempt with PyInstaller crashed immediately. The executable was created but died on launch with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"
- Tried cx_Freeze next - same issue. Binary runs but crashes when it tries to import numpy
- numpy is a NIGHTMARE dependency for frozen applications. It has tons of hidden imports and binary extensions

What I've Tried:
- Basic PyInstaller command: pyinstaller --onefile calculator.py
  Result: exe created but crashes on numpy import
  
- Added --hidden-import=numpy flag
  Result: Still crashes! numpy has SO MANY submodules
  
- Tried --hidden-import=numpy.core and --hidden-import=numpy.core._methods
  Result: Got further but now crashes on missing numpy.random or numpy.linalg stuff
  
- The problem is numpy loads modules dynamically at runtime, PyInstaller can't auto-detect them all

- Looked into using --collect-all=numpy but not sure if that's the right flag for my PyInstaller version

- Also numpy depends on MKL or OpenBLAS libraries which are binary .so/.dll files that might not be getting bundled

TODO:
- Research the EXACT hidden imports needed for numpy
- Maybe try Nuitka instead? Heard it handles scientific packages better
- Check if there's a spec file template for numpy applications
- Consider using --collect-submodules or --collect-data flags
- Test with a minimal numpy example first before trying full calculator app

This is taking way longer than expected. Management wants this deployed by end of week...
