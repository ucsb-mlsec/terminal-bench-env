ANALYSIS
===========================================

The executable was created successfully but crashes at runtime when attempting to import numpy.
The warning about missing libopenblas.so.0 during compilation is likely the cause.
NumPy has complex binary dependencies that weren't properly bundled.

Need to investigate:
- Missing numpy hooks
- Binary library dependencies (BLAS/LAPACK)
- Hidden imports not detected by PyInstaller

Next attempt should use explicit hidden imports and hook configurations.
