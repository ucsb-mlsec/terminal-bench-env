THEOREM: For all x, if x > 0, then x² > 0

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. Let x be an arbitrary real number
2. Assume x > 0

STEPS:
1. From assumption 2, we have x > 0
2. By the property of multiplication, when we multiply two positive numbers, the result is positive
3. Since x > 0, we can write x² = x · x
4. By step 2 and step 3, x · x > 0
5. Therefore, x² > 0

CONCLUSION: Therefore, for all x > 0, x² > 0
