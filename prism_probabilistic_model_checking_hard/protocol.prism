I'll solve this step by step.

First, let me create the PRISM model file, then analyze it to verify the safety requirements.

**Step 1: Create the PRISM model**

The model should represent a discrete-time Markov chain with the protocol behavior described.

<file path="/workspace/protocol.prism">
dtmc

module protocol
    attempt : [0..4] init 0;
    status : [0..2] init 0;
    
    [] attempt < 4 & status = 0 -> 0.8 : (status'=1) + 0.2 : (attempt'=attempt+1);
    [] attempt = 4 & status = 0 -> 1.0 : (status'=2);
    [] status = 1 -> 1.0 : (status'=1);
    [] status = 2 -> 1.0 : (status'=2);
    
endmodule

label "success" = status=1;
label "failure" = status=2;
</file>

**Step 2: Analyze the probabilities**

Now I need to calculate the probabilities:

- **Success probability**: The protocol succeeds if any of the 4 attempts succeeds
  - Attempt 0 succeeds: 0.8
  - Attempt 0 fails, Attempt 1 succeeds: 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16
  - Attempts 0-1 fail, Attempt 2 succeeds: 0.2² × 0.8 = 0.032
  - Attempts 0-2 fail, Attempt 3 succeeds: 0.2³ × 0.8 = 0.0064
  - Total success probability = 0.8 + 0.16 + 0.032 + 0.0064 = 0.9984

- **Failure probability**: All 4 attempts fail
  - Failure probability = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

**Step 3: Verify requirements**

- Requirement 1: P(success) ≥ 0.9984 → 0.9984 ≥ 0.9984 ✓ (met)
- Requirement 2: P(failure) ≤ 0.0016 → 0.0016 ≤ 0.0016 ✓ (met)

Both requirements are satisfied.

**Step 4: Save verification results**

<file path="/workspace/verification.txt">
success_probability=0.9984
failure_probability=0.0016
meets_safety_requirements=yes
</file>
