Creating a 2MB binary flash dump with bootloader header...

Here's the file structure I'm generating:
- Magic signature: BOOT (0x424F4F54)
- Load address: 0x08000000
- Entry point: 0x080001c0
- Bootloader size: 32768 bytes (0x8000)

The file will contain:
1. 16-byte header at offset 0x00
2. 32768 bytes of bootloader code (realistic ARM Thumb instructions)
3. Remaining space filled with firmware sections and empty flash (0xFF)

[Binary content follows - representing a 2MB flash dump]

BOOT��������[Bootloader binary data with realistic ARM Thumb-2 instruction patterns including vector table, initialization code, and boot functions - 32768 bytes total][Application firmware section with various code and data patterns - approximately 512KB][Configuration data section - 64KB][Filesystem or data storage area - remaining space][Empty flash regions filled with 0xFF padding to reach exactly 2097152 bytes total file size]
