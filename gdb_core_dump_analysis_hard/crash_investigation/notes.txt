CRASH INCIDENT NOTES - logparser daemon
================================================

First crash observed: January 15, 2024 at 14:32 UTC

The logparser service had been running stable in production for about 3 weeks
without any issues. We deployed version 2.1.4 last Friday (January 12th) and
everything seemed fine over the weekend.

Starting Monday afternoon, we've seen the logparser daemon segfault 3 times now,
always when processing the same type of log files. The crash is 100% reproducible
with sample.log - every time we feed it that file, the process crashes within
seconds.

The service was in the middle of processing log entries for analysis when it
went down. No recent changes to the log format that we're aware of, so something
in the new deployment must have introduced a regression.

I've preserved the core dump from the most recent crash along with the binary
and the input file that triggers it. All files are in /workspace/crash_investigation/
for the dev team to analyze.

We need root cause ASAP so the developers can patch this and we can redeploy.
The service is critical for our monitoring pipeline.
