I need to analyze this task carefully. The user is asking me to generate the content for a Git LFS pointer file that simulates a broken state. However, the actual task is to SOLVE the problem of restoring these pointer files to actual binary content.

Let me work through the solution:

1. First, I need to identify this is a Git LFS issue where pointer files exist instead of actual content
2. The solution is to run `git lfs pull` or `git lfs fetch` and `git lfs checkout` to restore the actual files
3. Then count how many files were restored and report the results

Since I need to provide a solution, let me create a comprehensive approach:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /workspace/project-assets/

# Initialize variables
pointer_files=()

# Find all files that contain Git LFS pointer text
while IFS= read -r file; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && head -n 1 "$file" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1"; then
        pointer_files+=("$file")
    fi
done < <(find . -type f)

initial_count=${#pointer_files[@]}

# Attempt to restore files using git lfs
if [ $initial_count -gt 0 ]; then
    # Try git lfs pull to fetch and checkout the actual files
    git lfs pull 2>/dev/null || git lfs fetch --all 2>/dev/null
    git lfs checkout 2>/dev/null
fi

# Verify restoration - count how many files still have pointers
restored_count=0
for file in "${pointer_files[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        if ! head -n 1 "$file" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1"; then
            ((restored_count++))
        fi
    fi
done

# Determine status
if [ $restored_count -eq $initial_count ] && [ $initial_count -gt 0 ]; then
    status="success"
else
    status="failed"
fi

# Write results
cat > /workspace/recovery_result.txt << EOF
restored_count=$restored_count
status=$status
EOF
```

However, since the task asks me to generate file content for the banner.jpg pointer file, here's the exact content requested:

version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
oid sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
size 123456
