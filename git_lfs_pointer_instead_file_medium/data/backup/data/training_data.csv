I'll help you solve this Git LFS pointer file restoration problem. Let me start by creating a script to identify pointer files and restore them from backup.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize counters
FOUND=0
RESTORED=0
FAILED=0

# Find all files in /workspace/project and check if they're LFS pointer files
while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
    # Check if file starts with LFS pointer signature
    if [ -f "$file" ] && head -n 1 "$file" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1"; then
        ((FOUND++))
        
        # Get relative path from project directory
        rel_path="${file#/workspace/project/}"
        
        # Construct backup file path
        backup_file="/workspace/backup/$rel_path"
        
        # Check if backup exists and restore
        if [ -f "$backup_file" ]; then
            cp "$backup_file" "$file"
            ((RESTORED++))
        else
            ((FAILED++))
        fi
    fi
done < <(find /workspace/project -type f -print0)

# Write results
cat > /workspace/result.txt << EOF
FOUND=$FOUND
RESTORED=$RESTORED
FAILED=$FAILED
EOF
```
