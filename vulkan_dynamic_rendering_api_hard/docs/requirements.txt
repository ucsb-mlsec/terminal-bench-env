VULKAN DYNAMIC RENDERING MIGRATION REQUIREMENTS
Version 1.0

This document specifies the mandatory configuration requirements for migrating a Vulkan application to use the VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering extension instead of traditional render passes.

================================================================================
1. REQUIRED VULKAN EXTENSIONS
================================================================================

The following device extensions MUST be enabled during logical device creation:

- VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering

Note: This extension requires Vulkan 1.1 or higher. Ensure that VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2 is available if using Vulkan 1.0.

================================================================================
2. REQUIRED DEVICE FEATURES
================================================================================

The following device feature flags MUST be enabled in VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures or extended feature structures:

- dynamicRendering (from VkPhysicalDeviceDynamicRenderingFeaturesKHR)

This feature must be queried during physical device selection and enabled during logical device creation. Applications should verify feature availability before attempting to use dynamic rendering.

================================================================================
3. PIPELINE CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Graphics pipelines created for use with dynamic rendering have the following requirements:

- The 'renderPass' field in VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo MUST be set to VK_NULL_HANDLE
- The 'subpass' field MUST be set to 0
- Pipelines are created without any render pass references
- Pipeline compatibility is determined by attachment formats rather than render pass compatibility

INCOMPATIBLE SETTINGS:
- Specifying a valid VkRenderPass handle in the renderPass field is INCOMPATIBLE with dynamic rendering and will cause initialization failures or undefined behavior

================================================================================
4. RENDERING FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

When using dynamic rendering, attachment formats must be explicitly declared:

REQUIRED FIELDS:
- colorAttachmentFormats: An array specifying the format of each color attachment (e.g., VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM, VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB)
- depthAttachmentFormat: The format for the depth attachment (e.g., VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT, VK_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT)
- stencilAttachmentFormat: The format for the stencil attachment if used separately

These format declarations are provided through VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfoKHR which must be included in the pNext chain of VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo.

Example format specifications:
- colorAttachmentFormats: [VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB]
- depthAttachmentFormat: VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT
