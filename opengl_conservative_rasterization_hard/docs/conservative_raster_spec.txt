CONSERVATIVE RASTERIZATION SPECIFICATION
=============================================

Version 1.2
Last Updated: 2024

INTRODUCTION
------------
This document specifies the requirements for implementing conservative
rasterization in the graphics rendering pipeline. Conservative rasterization
ensures predictable fragment generation behavior for collision detection,
voxelization, and other advanced rendering techniques.

REQUIRED EXTENSION
------------------
The system must use the following OpenGL extension:
  GL_NV_conservative_raster

This extension must be present and enabled in the extensions.conf file.
Alternative extensions are not supported in this version.

RASTERIZATION MODES
-------------------
Two modes are supported:

1. overestimate: Fragments are generated for any pixel that is touched by
   a primitive, even partially. This ensures no geometry is missed but may
   produce extra fragments.

2. underestimate: Fragments are only generated for pixels that are fully
   covered by the primitive. This produces fewer fragments but guarantees
   complete coverage where fragments are generated.

DILATION FACTOR SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------------
The dilation factor controls pixel boundary expansion for conservative tests.

Valid range: 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive)
Default recommended value: 0.5
Factors must be positive (greater than or equal to 0.0)

A dilation factor of 0.0 means no dilation (standard rasterization).
A dilation factor of 1.0 means maximum dilation (full pixel expansion).

Values outside this range will cause validation failure.

PIXEL COVERAGE GUARANTEES
-------------------------
overestimate mode: Guarantees that if any part of a primitive touches a pixel,
that pixel will generate a fragment. No geometry can be missed.

underestimate mode: Guarantees that only pixels completely inside the primitive
boundary will generate fragments. Useful for conservative occlusion culling.

CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
1. All configuration files (pipeline.conf, extensions.conf, rasterizer.conf)
   must specify the same rasterization mode
2. Extension identifier must exactly match the required extension string
3. Dilation factor must be within valid range and consistent across files
4. No conflicting parameters are allowed between configuration files
