Power Trace Collection Metadata
=====================================

ACQUISITION PARAMETERS
----------------------
Sampling rate: 500 MS/s (mega-samples per second)
Number of traces: 5000
Samples per trace: 3000
Total acquisition time per trace: 6 microseconds
Trigger point: Sample 200 (encryption starts at this sample)

DEVICE INFORMATION
------------------
Device: AES-128 hardware implementation
Algorithm: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128)
Key size: 128 bits (16 bytes)
Encryption mode: ECB (Electronic Codebook)
Device architecture: 8-bit microcontroller with hardware AES accelerator

TARGET OPERATION
----------------
Target operation: First round SubBytes after AddRoundKey
Leakage model: Hamming weight of S-box output
Leakage point: Power consumption during byte substitution in round 1
Expected leakage window: Samples 200-800 (approximately)

SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS
----------------------
Noise level: Gaussian noise with standard deviation 0.3
Signal-to-noise ratio: Moderate (SNR ~5-10 dB)
Trace alignment: All traces synchronized to encryption trigger
Sampling jitter: Negligible (< 0.5 samples)

DATA QUALITY NOTES
------------------
- Traces exhibit strong correlation with Hamming weight model during SubBytes operation
- Each of the 16 S-box operations appears sequentially in the power trace
- Byte operations are processed serially, allowing individual byte recovery
- Power consumption peaks are visible around samples 250-750
- Background noise is predominantly Gaussian with minimal outliers
- No significant electromagnetic interference detected during acquisition
- Temperature maintained at 25°C ± 2°C during all measurements

ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
- Use Pearson correlation coefficient for key recovery
- Target Hamming weight of S-box(plaintext_byte XOR key_byte) as leakage model
- Process each key byte independently using corresponding plaintext bytes
- Expected correlation peaks: 0.7-0.9 for correct key hypothesis
- Incorrect key hypotheses typically show correlation < 0.3
- Consider averaging correlation across multiple sample points for robustness

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
---------------------
This dataset demonstrates vulnerability to Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attacks.
The device shows significant side-channel leakage during cryptographic operations.
Countermeasures such as masking or noise injection should be implemented in production devices.
